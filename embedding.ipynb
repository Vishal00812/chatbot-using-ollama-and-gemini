A stage is reached when\\nthe solid melts and is converted to a liquid.\\nThe minimum temperature at which a solid\\nmelts to become a liquid at the atmospheric\\npressure is called its melting point.\\nThe melting point of a solid is an indication\\nof the strength of the force of attraction\\nbetween its particles.\\nThe melting point of ice is 273.15 K *. The\\nprocess of melting, that is, change of solid\\nstate into liquid state is also known as fusion.\\nWhen a solid melts, its temperature\\nremains the same, so where does the heat\\nenergy go?\\nYou must have observed, during the\\nexperiment of melting, that the temperatur e\\nof the system does not change after the\\nmelting point is reached, till all the ice melts.\\nThis happens even though we continue to\\nheat the beaker, that is, we continue to supply\\nheat. This heat gets used up in changing thestate by overcoming the forces of attraction\\nbetween the particles. As this heat energy is\\nabsorbed by ice without showing any rise in\\ntemperatur e, it is consider ed that it gets\\nhidden into the contents of the beaker and is\\nknown as the latent heat. The wor d latent\\nmeans hidden. The amount of heat ener gy\\nthat is r equir ed to change 1 kg of a solid into\\nliquid at atmospheric pr essur e at its melting\\npoint is known as the latent heat of fusion.\\nSo, particles in water at 0oC (273 K) have more\\nenergy as compared to particles in ice at the\\nsame temperature.\\nWhen we supply heat ener gy to water ,\\nparticles start moving even faster .  At a certain\\ntemperatur e, a point is r eached when the\\nparticles have enough energy to break fr ee\\nfrom the forces of attraction of each other . At\\nthis temperatur e the liquid starts changing\\ninto gas. The temperature at which a liquid\\nstarts boiling at the atmospheric pr essur e is\\nknown as its boiling point. Boiling is a bulk\\nphenomenon. Particles fr om the bulk of the\\nliquid gain enough ener gy to change into the\\nvapour state.\\nFor water this temperature is 373 K\\n(100oC = 273 + 100 = 373 K).\\nCan you define the latent heat of\\nvaporisation? Do it in the same way as we\\nhave defined the latent heat of fusion.\\nParticles in steam, that is, water vapour at\\n373 K (1000 C) have mor e ener gy than water\\nat the same temperatur e. This is because\\nparticles in steam have absorbed extra ener gy\\nin the for m of latent heat of vaporisation.\\n*Note: Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature, 0o C =273.15 K. For convenience, we take 0o C = 273 K after\\nrounding off the decimal. To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you\\nhave to subtract 273 from the given temperature, and to convert a temperature on the Celsius\\nscale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature.So, we infer that the state of matter can\\nbe changed into another state by changing\\nthe temperature.\\nWe have lear nt that substances ar ound\\nus change state fr om solid to liquid and fr om\\nliquid to gas on application of heat.

Due to the relatively\\nsmaller size of particles, as compared to that of\\na suspension, the mixture appears to be\\nhomogeneous.

This\\nscattering of a beam of light is called the\\nTyndall effect after the name of the scientist\\nwho discovered this effect.\\nTyndall effect can also be observed when a\\nfine beam of light enters a room through a small\\nhole. This happens due to the scattering of light\\nby the particles of dust and smoke in the air .\\nFig. 2.3: (a) Solution of copper sulphate does not\\nshow Tyndall effect, (b) mixture of water\\nand milk shows Tyndall effect.(a) (b)\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

For\\nexample, the name copper was taken from\\nCyprus. Some names were taken from\\nspecific colours. For example, gold was taken\\nfrom the English word meaning yellow.\\nNow-a-days, IUPAC (International Union of\\nPure and Applied Chemistry) is an\\ninternational scientific organisation which\\napproves names of elements, symbols and\\nunits.

According to him, each element had a\\ncharacteristic atomic mass. The theory could\\nexplain the law of constant proportions so well\\nthat scientists were prompted to measure the\\natomic mass of an atom. Since determining the\\nmass of an individual atom was a relatively\\ndifficult task, relative atomic masses were\\ndetermined using the laws of chemical\\ncombinations and the compounds formed.\\nLet us take the example of a compound,\\ncarbon monoxide (CO) formed by carbon and\\noxygen. It was observed experimentally that 3\\ng of carbon combines with 4 g of oxygen to\\nform CO. In other words, carbon combines\\nwith 4/3 times its mass of oxygen. Suppose\\nwe define the atomic mass unit (earlier\\nabbreviated as ‘amu’, but according to the\\nlatest IUPAC recommendations, it is now\\nwritten as ‘u’ – unified mass) as equal to the\\nmass of one carbon atom, then we would\\nassign carbon an atomic mass of 1.0 u and\\noxygen an atomic mass of 1.33 u.

Thomson. Even before the electron was\\nidentified, E. Goldstein in 1886 discovered the\\npresence of new radiations  in a gas discharge\\nand called them canal rays. These rays were\\npositively charged radiations which ultimately\\nled to the discovery of another sub-atomic\\nparticle. This sub-atomic particle had a charge,\\nequal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that\\nof the electron. Its mass was approximately\\n2000 times as that of the electron. It was given\\nthe name of proton. In general, an electron is\\nrepresented as ‘e–’ and a proton as ‘p+’. The\\nmass of a proton  is taken as one unit and its\\ncharge as plus one.

But the\\ndiscovery of two fundamental particles\\n(electr ons and pr otons) inside the atom, led\\nto the failur e of this aspect of Dalton’s atomic\\ntheory. It was then consider ed necessary to\\nknow how electr ons and pr otons ar e arranged\\nwithin an atom. For explaining this, many\\nscientists pr oposed various atomic models.\\nJ.J. Thomson was the first one to pr opose a\\nmodel for the structure of an atom.\\n4.2.1 THOMSON ’S MODEL  OF AN ATOM\\nThomson proposed the model of an atom to\\nbe similar to that of a Christmas pudding.\\nThe electrons, in a spher e of positive charge,\\nwere like currants (dry fruits) in a spherical\\nChristmas pudding. W e can also think of a\\nwater melon, the positive char ge in the atom\\nis spr ead all over like the r ed edible part of\\nthe water melon, while the electr ons ar e\\nstudded in the positively char ged spher e, like\\nthe seeds in the water melon (Fig. 4.1).Thomson pr oposed that:\\n(i)An atom consists of a positively\\ncharged spher e and the electr ons ar e\\nembedded in it.\\n(ii)The negative and positive char ges ar e\\nequal in magnitude. So, the atom as a\\nwhole is electrically neutral.\\nAlthough Thomson’s model explained that\\natoms ar e electrically neutral, the results of\\nexperiments carried out by other scientists\\ncould not be explained by this model, as we\\nwill see below.\\n4.2.2 RUTHERFORD ’S MODEL  OF AN ATOM\\nErnest Ruther ford was inter ested in knowing\\nhow the electr ons ar e arranged within an\\natom. Ruther ford designed an experiment for\\nthis. In this experiment, fast moving alpha\\n(α)-particles wer e made to fall on a thin\\ngold foil.\\n•He selected a gold foil because he wanted\\nas thin a layer as possible. This gold foil\\nwas about 1000 atoms thick.\\n•α-particles ar e doubly-char ged helium\\nions. Since they have a mass of 4 u, the\\nfast-moving α-particles have a\\nconsiderable amount of ener gy.\\n•It was expected that α-particles would be\\ndeflected by the sub-atomic particles in\\nthe gold atoms. Since the α-particles wer e\\nmuch heavier than the pr otons, he did\\nnot expect to see lar ge deflections.Q\\nFig.4.1:  Thomson’s model of an atomJ.J.

This is\\nbecause there are lots of gaps in the fence\\nwhich allow the stone to pass through them.\\nFollowing a similar reasoning, Rutherford\\nconcluded fr om the α-particle scattering\\nexperiment that—\\n(i)Most of the space inside the atom is\\nempty because most of the α -particles\\npassed thr ough the gold foil without\\ngetting deflected.\\n(ii) V ery few particles were deflected fr om\\ntheir path, indicating that the positive\\ncharge of the atom occupies very little\\nspace.\\n(iii) A very small fraction of α-particles\\nwere deflected by 1800, indicating that\\nall the positive char ge and mass of the\\ngold atom were concentrated in a very\\nsmall volume within the atom.\\nFrom the data he also calculated that the\\nradius of the nucleus is about 105 times less\\nthan the radius of the atom.\\nOn the basis of his experiment,\\nRuther ford put forwar d the nuclear model of\\nan atom, which had the following featur es:\\n(i)There is a positively char ged centr e in\\nan atom called the nucleus.

All activities inside the cell and\\ninteractions of the cell with its envir onment\\nare possible due to these featur es. Let us see\\nhow.\\n5.2.1 PLASMA  MEMBRANE  OR CELL\\nMEMBRANE\\nThis is the outer most covering of the cell that\\nseparates the contents of the cell fr om its\\nexternal envir onment. The plasma membrane\\nallows or per mits the entry and exit of some\\nmaterials in and out of the cell. It also\\nprevents movement of some other materials.\\nThe cell membrane, ther efore, is called a\\nselectively per meable membrane.\\nHow does the movement of substances\\ntake place into the cell? How do substances\\nmove out of the cell?\\nSome substances like carbon dioxide or\\noxygen can move acr oss the cell membrane\\nby a pr ocess called dif fusion. W e have studied\\nthe pr ocess of dif fusion in earlier chapters.\\nWe saw that there is spontaneous movement\\nof a substance fr om a r egion of high\\nconcentration to a r egion wher e its\\nconcentration is low.\\nSomething similar to this happens in cells\\nwhen, for example, some substance like CO2\\n(which is cellular waste and r equir es to be\\nexcreted out by the cell) accumulates in high\\nconcentrations inside the cell. In the cell’s\\nexter nal envir onment, the concentration of\\nCO2 is low as compar ed to that inside the\\ncell. As soon as ther e is a dif ference of\\nconcentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell,\\nCO2 moves out of the cell, fr om a r egion of\\nhigh concentration, to a r egion of low\\nconcentration outside the cell by the pr ocess\\nof dif fusion. Similarly, O2 enters the cell by\\nthe pr ocess of dif fusion when the level or\\nconcentration of O2 inside the cell decreases.\\nThus, dif fusion plays an important r ole in\\ngaseous exchange between the cells as well\\nas the cell and its exter nal envir onment.\\nWater also obeys the law of dif fusion. The\\nmovement of water molecules through such a\\nselectively permeable membrane is called osmosis.Q\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'class9\\\\combined_1.pdf', 'page': 51}, page_content='SCIENCE 52The movement of water across the plasma\\nmembrane is also affected by the\\namount of substance dissolved in water. Thus,\\nosmosis is the net diffusion of water across a\\nselectively permeable membrane toward a\\nhigher solute concentration .\\nWhat will happen if we put an animal cell\\nor a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt\\nin water?\\nOne of the following thr ee things could\\nhappen:\\n1.If the medium surrounding the cell has\\na higher water concentration than the\\ncell, meaning that the outside solution\\nis very dilute, the cell will gain water by\\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\\na hypotonic solution.\\nWater molecules are free to pass\\nacross the cell membrane in both\\ndirections, but more water will come\\ninto the cell than will leave. The net\\n(overall) result is that water enters the\\ncell. The cell is likely to swell up.\\n2.If the medium has exactly the same\\nwater concentration as the cell, there\\nwill be no net movement of water across\\nthe cell membrane. Such a solution is\\nknown as an isotonic solution.\\nWater crosses the cell membrane in\\nboth directions, but the amount going\\nin is the same as the amount going out,\\nso there is no overall movement of\\nwater. The cell will stay the same size.\\n3.If the medium has a lower\\nconcentration of water than the cell,\\nmeaning that it is a very concentrated\\nsolution, the cell will lose water by\\nosmosis. Such a solution is known as\\na hypertonic solution.\\nAgain, water cr osses the cell\\nmembrane in both dir ections, but this\\ntime mor e water leaves the cell than\\nenters it. Ther efore the cell will shrink.\\nThus, osmosis is a special case of dif fusion\\nthrough a selectively permeable membrane.\\nNow let us try out the following activity:Activity ______________ 5.3\\nOsmosis with an egg\\n(a)Remove the shell of an egg by dissolving\\nit in dilute hydr ochloric acid. The shell\\nis mostly calcium carbonate. A thin\\nouter skin now encloses the egg. Put\\nthe egg in pur e water and observe after\\n5 minutes. What do we observe?\\nThe egg swells because water passes\\ninto it by osmosis.\\n(b)Place a similar de-shelled egg in a\\nconcentrated salt solution and observe\\nfor 5 minutes. The egg shrinks. Why?\\nWater passes out of the egg solution\\ninto the salt solution because the salt\\nsolution is mor e concentrated.\\nWe can also try a similar activity with dried\\nraisins or apricots.\\nActivity ______________ 5.4\\n•Put dried raisins or apricots in plain\\nwater and leave them for some time.\\nThen place them into a concentrated\\nsolution of sugar or salt. Y ou will\\nobserve the following:\\n(a)Each gains water and swells\\nwhen placed in water .\\n(b)However , when placed in the\\nconcentrated solution it loses\\nwater , and consequently shrinks.\\nUnicellular freshwater organisms and\\nmost plant cells tend to gain water thr ough\\nosmosis. Absorption of water by plant r oots\\nis also an example of osmosis.\\nThus, dif fusion is important in exhange\\nof gases and water in the life of a cell. In\\nadditions to this, the cell also obtains\\nnutrition fr om its envir onment. Dif ferent\\nmolecules move in and out of the cell\\nthrough a type of transport r equiring use\\nof ener gy.\\nThe plasma membrane is flexible and is\\nmade up of organic molecules called lipids\\nand pr oteins. However , we can observe the\\nstructur e of the plasma membrane only\\nthrough an electr on micr oscope.\\nThe flexibility of the cell membrane also\\nenables the cell to engulf in food and other\\nmaterial from its external environment.

All through his life,\\nhe continued to work on these lines,\\nmodifying and improving this technique.\\nGolgi received the highest honours and\\nawards in recognition of his work.

These\\nenzymes ar e made by RER. L ysosomes are a\\nkind of waste disposal system of the cell. These\\nhelp to keep the cell clean by digesting any\\nforeign material as well as worn-out cell\\norganelles. Foreign materials entering the cell,\\nsuch as bacteria or food, as well as old\\norganelles end up in the lysosomes, which\\nbreak complex substances into simpler\\nsubstances. L ysosomes ar e able to do this\\nbecause they contain powerful digestive\\nenzymes capable of breaking down all organic\\nmaterial.

These membranes\\noften have connections with the membranes\\nof ER and therefore constitute another portion\\nof a complex cellular membrane system.\\nThe material synthesised near the ER is\\npackaged and dispatched to various tar gets\\ninside and outside the cell thr ough the Golgi\\napparatus. Its functions include the storage,\\nmodification and packaging of pr oducts in\\nvesicles. In some cases, complex sugars may\\nbe made from simple sugars in the Golgi\\napparatus. The Golgi apparatus is also\\ninvolved in the formation of lysosomes [see\\n5.2.5 (iii)].\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

Mitochondria have two membrane\\ncoverings. The outer membrane is porous\\nwhile the inner membrane is deeply folded.\\nThese folds increase surface area for ATP-\\ngenerating chemical reactions. The energy\\nrequired for various chemical activities needed\\nfor life is released by mitochondria in the form\\nof ATP (Adenosine triphopshate) molecules.\\nATP is known as the energy currency of the\\ncell.

Therefore, mitochondria are able\\nto make some of their own proteins.\\n5.2.5 ( V) PLASTIDS\\nPlastids are present only in plant cells. There\\nare two types of plastids – chromoplasts\\n(coloured plastids) and leucoplasts (white or\\ncolourless plastids). Chromoplasts containing\\nthe pigment chlorophyll are known as\\nchloroplasts. Chloroplasts are important for\\nphotosynthesis in plants. Chloroplasts also\\ncontain various yellow or orange pigments in\\naddition to chlorophyll. Leucoplasts are\\nprimarily organelles in which materials such\\nas starch, oils and protein granules are stored.\\nThe internal organisation of the Ch loroplast\\nconsists of numerous membrane layers\\nembedded in a material called the stroma. These\\nare similar to mitochondria in external\\nstructure.

V acuoles are small sized in animal\\ncells while plant cells have very large vacuoles .\\nThe central vacuole of some plant cells may\\noccupy 50-90% of the cell volume.In plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap\\nand provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell.\\nMany substances of importance in the life of\\nthe plant cell are stored in vacuoles. These\\ninclude amino acids, sugars, various organic\\nacids and some proteins. In single-celled\\norganisms like Amoeba , the food vacuole\\ncontains the food items that the Amoeba\\n has\\nconsumed.

In unicellular\\norganisms, a single cell per forms all basic\\nfunctions. For example, in Amoeba, a single\\ncell carries out movement, intake of food,\\ngaseous exchange and excretion. But in multi-\\ncellular organisms there are millions of cells.\\nMost of these cells are specialised to carry out\\nspecific functions. Each specialised function\\nis taken up by a different group of cells. Since\\nthese cells carry out only a particular function,\\nthey do it very efficiently. In human beings,\\nmuscle cells contract and relax to cause\\nmovement, nerve cells carry messages, blood\\nflows to transport oxygen, food, hormones and\\nwaste material and so on. In plants, vascular\\ntissues conduct food and water from one part\\nof the plant to other parts. So, multi-cellular\\norganisms show division of labour . Cells\\nspecialising in one function are often grouped\\ntogether in the body. This means that a\\nparticular function is carried out by a cluster\\nof cells at a definite place in the body. This\\ncluster of cells, called a tissue, is arranged and\\ndesigned so as to give the highest possible\\nefficiency of function. Blood, phloem and\\nmuscle are all examples of tissues.\\nA group of cells that are similar in structure\\nand/or work together to achieve a particular\\nfunction forms a tissue.\\n6.1Are Plants and Animals Made\\nof Same Types of Tissues?\\nLet us compar e their structur e and functions.\\nDo plants and animals have the same\\nstructur e? Do they both per form similar\\nfunctions?There are noticeable differences between\\nthe two. Plants are stationary or fixed – they\\ndon’t move. Since they have to be upright, they\\nhave a large quantity of supportive tissue. The\\nsupportive tissue generally has dead cells.\\nAnimals on the other hand move around\\nin sear ch of food, mates and shelter . They\\nconsume more energy as compared to plants.\\nMost of the tissues they contain are living.\\nAnother difference between animals and\\nplants is in the pattern of growth. The growth\\nin plants is limited to certain regions, while this\\nis not so in animals. There are some tissues in\\nplants that divide throughout their life. These\\ntissues are localised in certain regions. Based\\non the dividing capacity of the tissues, various\\nplant tissues can be classified as growing or\\nmeristematic tissue and permanent tissue. Cell\\ngrowth in animals is more uniform. So, there\\nis no such demarcation of dividing and non-\\ndividing regions in animals.\\nThe structural organisation of organs and\\norgan systems is far more specialised and\\nlocalised in complex animals than even in very\\ncomplex plants. This fundamental difference\\nreflects the different modes of life pursued by\\nthese two major groups of organisms,\\nparticularly in their different feeding methods.\\nAlso, they are differently adapted for a\\nsedentary existence on one hand (plants) and\\nactive locomotion on the other (animals),\\ncontributing to this difference in organ system\\ndesign.\\nIt is with reference to these complex animal\\nand plant bodies that we will now talk about\\nthe concept of tissues in some detail.6\\nT TTTTISSUES\\nISSUESISSUES ISSUESISSUESChapter\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The skin, the lining of the\\nmouth, the lining of blood vessels, lung alveoli\\nand kidney tubules are all made of epithelial\\ntissue.

Regardless of the type, all\\nepithelium is usually separated from the\\nunderlying tissue by an extracellular fibrous\\nbasement membrane.\\nDifferent epithelia (Fig. 6.9) show differing\\nstructures that correlate with their unique\\nfunctions.

The rate at which objects move can\\nbe dif ferent. Also, dif ferent objects can move\\nat the same rate. One of the ways of\\nmeasuring the rate of motion of an object is\\nto find out the distance travelled by the object\\nin unit time. This quantity is r eferred to as\\nspeed. The SI unit of speed is metr e per\\nsecond. This is r epresented by the symbol\\nm s–1 or m/s. The other units of speed include\\ncentimetr e per second (cm s–1) and kilometr e\\nper hour (km h–1).

When an object is moving\\nalong a straight line at a variable speed, we\\ncan expr ess the magnitude of its rate of\\nmotion in ter ms of average velocity.

Thus, for uniform\\nspeed, a graph of distance travelled against\\ntime is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 7.3.\\nThe portion OB of the graph shows that the\\ndistance is increasing at a uniform rate.

He observed that when a marble\\nrolls down an inclined plane, its velocity\\nincreases [Fig. 8.5(a)]. In the next chapter , you\\nwill learn that the marble falls under the\\nunbalanced force of gravity as it r olls down\\nand attains a definite velocity by the time it\\nreaches the bottom. Its velocity decreases\\nwhen it climbs up as shown in Fig. 8.5(b).\\nFig. 8.5(c) shows a marble resting on an ideal\\nfrictionless plane inclined on both sides.\\nGalileo ar gued that when the marble is\\nreleased fr om left, it would r oll down the slope\\nand go up on the opposite side to the same\\nheight fr om which it was r eleased. If the\\ninclinations of the planes on both sides ar e\\nequal then the marble will climb the same\\ndistance that it cover ed while r\\nolling down. If\\nthe angle of inclination of the right-side plane\\nwere gradually decr eased, then the marble\\nwould travel further distances till it r eaches\\nthe original height. If the right-side plane wer e\\nultimately made horizontal (that is, the slope\\nis reduced to zer o), the marble would continue\\nto travel for ever trying to r each the same\\nheight that it was r eleased fr om. The\\nunbalanced forces on the marble in this case\\nare zero. It thus suggests that an unbalanced\\n(exter nal) for ce is r equir ed to change the\\nmotion of the marble but no net for ce is\\nneeded to sustain the unifor m motion of the\\nmarble.  In practical situations it is dif ficult\\nto achieve a zer o unbalanced for ce.

These thr ee laws ar e known as\\nNewton’s laws of motion. The first law of\\nmotion is stated as:\\nAn object r emains in a state of r est or of\\nunifor m motion in a straight line unless\\ncompelled to change that state by an\\napplied force.\\nIn other words, all objects resist a change\\nin their state of motion . In a qualitative way,\\nthe tendency of undisturbed objects to stay\\nat rest or to keep moving with the same\\nvelocity is called inertia. This is why, the first\\nlaw of motion is also known as the law\\nof inertia.\\nCertain experiences that we come across\\nwhile travelling in a motor car can be\\nexplained on the basis of the law of inertia.\\nWe tend to r emain at rest with r espect to the\\nseat until the driver applies a braking for ce\\nto stop the motor car.

This is because work is\\ndone on it against gravity while it is being\\nraised. The energy present in such an object\\nis the gravitational potential energy.\\nThe gravitational potential ener gy of an\\nobject at a point above the gr ound is defined\\nas the work done in raising it fr om the gr ound\\nto that point against gravity.\\nIt is easy to arrive at an expr ession for\\nthe gravitational potential ener gy of an object\\nat a height.\\nFig. 10.7\\nConsider an object of mass, m . Let it be\\nraised thr ough a height, h from the gr ound.\\nA force is r equir ed to do this. The minimum\\nforce requir ed to raise the object is equal to\\nthe weight of the object, mg. The object gains\\nenergy equal to the work done on it.  Let the\\nwork done on the object against gravity be\\nW. That is,\\nwork done, W=force × displacement\\n= mg × h\\n= mgh\\nSince work done on the object is equal to\\nmgh, an energy equal to mgh units is gained\\nby the object. This is the potential energy ( EP)\\nof the object.\\nEp = mgh (10.6)\\nMore to knowThe potential energy of an object at\\na height depends on the ground level\\nor the zero level you choose.  An\\nobject in a given position can have a\\ncertain potential energy with respect\\nto one level and a different value of\\npotential energy with respect to\\nanother level.\\nIt is useful to note that the work done by\\ngravity depends on the difference in vertical\\nheights of the initial and final positions of\\nthe object and not on the path along which\\nthe object is moved. Fig. 10.8 shows a case\\nwhere a block is raised fr om position A to B\\nby taking two dif ferent paths. Let the height\\nAB = h. In both the situations the work done\\non the object is mgh.\\nFig. 10.8\\nExample 10.5  Find the energy possessed\\nby an object of mass 10 kg when it is at\\na height of 6 m above the gr ound.

What happens to the total\\nenergy of a system during or after the process?\\nWhenever energy gets transformed, the total\\nenergy remains unchanged. This is the law of\\nconservation of energy. According to this law,\\nenergy can only be converted from one form\\nto another; it can neither be created or\\ndestroyed. The total energy before and after\\nthe transformation remains the same. The law\\nof conservation of energy is valid                  in\\nall situations and for all kinds of\\ntransformations.\\nConsider a simple example. Let an object\\nof mass, m be made to fall freely from a     height,\\nh. At the start, the potential energy is  mgh and\\nkinetic energy is zero. Why is the kinetic\\nenergy zero? It is zero because its velocity is\\nzero. The total energy of the object is thus mgh.\\nAs it falls, its potential energy will change into\\nkinetic energy. If v is the velocity of the object\\nat a given instant, the kinetic energy would be\\n½mv2. As the fall of the object continues, the\\npotential energy would decrease while the\\nkinetic energy would increase. When the object\\nis about to reach the ground, h = 0 and v  will\\nbe the highest. Therefore, the kinetic energy\\nwould be the largest and potential energy the\\nleast.  However , the sum of the potential ener gy\\nand kinetic energy of the object would be the\\nsame at all points. That is,\\npotential energy + kinetic energy = constant\\n   or\\n1constant.\\n22mgh + mv = (10.7)\\nThe sum of kinetic energy and potential energy\\nof an object is its total mechanical energy.\\nWe find that during the fr ee fall of the object,\\nthe decrease in potential energy, at any point\\nin its path, appears as an equal amount of\\nincrease in kinetic energy. (Here the effect of\\nair resistance on the motion of the object has\\nbeen ignored.) There is thus a continual\\ntransformation of gravitational potential\\nenergy into kinetic energy.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

A particle of\\nthe medium in contact with the vibrating\\nobject is first displaced fr om its equilibrium\\nposition. It then exerts a for ce on the adjacent\\nparticle. As a r esult of which the adjacent\\nparticle gets displaced fr om its position of\\nrest. After displacing the adjacent particle the\\nfirst particle comes back to its original\\nposition. This pr ocess continues in the\\nmedium till the sound r eaches your ear . The\\ndisturbance created by a source of  sound in\\nthe medium travels through the medium and\\nnot the particles of the medium.\\nA wave is a disturbance that moves\\nthrough a medium when the particles of the\\nmedium set neighbouring particles into\\nmotion. They in tur n produce similar motion\\nin others. The particles of the medium do not\\nmove forwar d themselves, but the\\ndisturbance is carried forwar d. This is what\\nhappens during pr opagation of sound in a\\nmedium, hence sound can be visualised as a\\nwave. Sound waves are characterised by the\\nmotion of particles in the medium and ar e\\ncalled mechanical waves.\\nAir is the most common medium thr ough\\nwhich sound travels. When a vibrating object\\nmoves forward, it pushes and compresses the\\nair in front of it creating a region of high\\npressur e. This r egion is called a compr ession\\n(C), as shown in Fig. 11.4. This compression\\nstarts to move away from the vibrating object.\\nWhen the vibrating object moves backwar ds,\\nit creates a r egion of low pr essur e called\\nrarefaction (R), as shown in Fig. 11.4. As the\\nobject moves back and forth rapidly, a series\\nof compressions and rarefactions is created in\\nthe air . These make the sound wave thatFig. 11.3: Both the prongs of the vibrating tuning\\nfork dipped in water\\nFrom the above activities what do you\\nconclude?

W e can\\nalso pr oduce sound by plucking, scratching,\\nrubbing, blowing or shaking dif ferent objects.\\nAs per the above activities what do we do to\\nthe objects? W e set the objects vibrating and\\nproduce sound. V ibration means a kind of\\nrapid to and fr o motion of an object.

Y ou hold the other end.\\nNow str etch the slinky as shown in\\nFig. 11.5(a). Then give it a sharp push\\ntowards your friend.\\n•What do you notice? If you move your\\nhand pushing and pulling the slinky\\nalternatively, what will you observe?\\n•If you mark a dot on the slinky, you\\nwill observe that the dot on the slinky\\nwill move back and forth parallel to\\nthe direction of the propagation of the\\ndisturbance.The regions where the coils become closer\\nare called compressions (C) and the regions\\nwhere the coils are further apart are called\\nrarefactions (R). As we already know, sound\\npropagates in the medium as a series of\\ncompressions and rarefactions. Now, we can\\ncompare the propagation of disturbance in a\\nslinky with the sound propagation in the\\nmedium. These waves are called longitudinal\\nwaves. In these waves the individual particles\\nof the medium move in a direction parallel to\\nthe direction of propagation of the disturbance.\\nThe particles do not move from one place to\\nanother but they simply oscillate back and\\nforth about their position of rest. This is\\nexactly how a sound wave propagates, hence\\nsound waves are longitudinal waves.\\nThere is also another type of wave, called\\na transverse wave. In a transverse wave\\nparticles do not oscillate along the direction\\nof wave propagation but oscillate up and down\\nabout their mean position as the wave travels.\\nThus, a transverse wave is the one in which\\nthe individual particles of the medium move\\nabout their mean positions in a direction\\nperpendicular to the direction of wave\\npropagation. When we drop a pebble in a\\npond, the waves you see on the water surface\\nis an example of transverse wave. Light is a\\ntransverse wave but for light, the oscillations\\nare not of the medium particles or their\\npressure or density— it is not a mechanical\\nwave.

The\\nfaster the vibration of the source, the\\nhigher is the frequency and the higher is\\nthe pitch, as shown in Fig. 11.7. Thus, a\\nhigh pitch sound corresponds to more\\nnumber of compressions and rarefactions\\npassing a fixed point per unit time.\\nObjects of different sizes and conditions\\nvibrate at different frequencies to produce\\nsounds of different pitch.\\nThe magnitude of the maximum\\ndisturbance in the medium on either side of\\nthe mean value is called the amplitude of the\\nwave. It is usually represented by the letter A,as shown in Fig. 11.6(c). For sound its unit\\nwill be that of density or pressure.\\nThe loudness or softness of a sound is\\ndetermined basically by its amplitude. The\\namplitude of the sound wave depends upon\\nthe force with which an object is made to\\nvibrate. If we strike a table lightly, we hear a\\nsoft sound because we produce a sound wavedensity of the medium oscillates between a\\nmaximum value and a minimum value. The\\nchange in density from the maximum value\\nto the minimum value, then again to the\\nmaximum value, makes one complete\\noscillation. The number of such oscillations\\nper unit time is the frequency of the sound\\nwave. If we can count the number of the\\ncompressions or rarefactions that cross us\\nper unit time, we will get the frequency of\\nthe sound wave. It is usually represented by\\nν (Greek letter , nu).

If we hit the table\\nhard we hear a louder sound. Can you tell\\nwhy? A sound wave spreads out from its\\nsource.

The sound of a thunder is heard  a little\\nlater than the flash of light is seen. So, we can\\nmake out that sound travels with a speed\\nwhich is much less than the speed of light. The\\nspeed of sound depends on the properties of\\nthe medium thr ough which it travels. Y ou will\\nlearn about this dependence in higher classes.\\nThe speed of sound in a medium depends on\\ntemperature of the medium. The speed of\\nsound decreases when we go from solid to\\ngaseous state. In any medium as we increase\\nthe temperature, the speed of sound increases.\\nFor example, the speed of sound in air is 331\\nm s–1 at 0 ºC and 344 m s–1 at 22 ºC.

This sound which we\\nhear is called an echo. The sensation of\\nsound persists in our brain for about 0.1\\ns. To hear a distinct echo the time interval\\nbetween the original sound and the\\nreflected one must be  at least 0.1s. If we\\ntake the speed of sound to be 344 m/s at a\\ngiven temperatur e, say at 22 ºC in air , the\\nsound must go to the obstacle and reach\\nback the ear of the listener on reflection after\\n0.1s. Hence, the total distance covered by\\nthe sound from the point of generation to\\nthe reflecting surface and back should be\\nat least (344 m/s) × 0.1 s = 34.4 m. Thus,\\nfor hearing distinct echoes, the minimum\\ndistance of the obstacle from the source of\\nsound must be half of this distance, that\\nis, 17.2 m. This distance will change with\\nthe temperatur e of air . Echoes may be hear d\\nmore than once due to successive or\\nmultiple reflections. The rolling of thunder\\nis due to the successive reflections of the\\nsound from a number of reflecting surfaces,\\nsuch as the clouds and the land.\\n11.3.2 REVERBERATION\\nA sound created in a big hall will persist\\nby repeated reflection from the walls until\\nit is reduced to a value where it is no longer\\naudible. The repeated reflection that\\nresults in this persistence of sound is\\ncalled reverberation. In an auditorium or\\nbig hall excessive reverberation is highly\\nundesirable. To reduce reverberation, the\\nroof and walls of the auditorium are\\ngenerally covered with sound-absorbent\\nmaterials like compressed fibreboard,\\nrough plaster or draperies. The seat\\nmaterials are also selected on the basis of\\ntheir sound absorbing properties.\\nExample 11.2  A person clapped his hands\\nnear a cliff and heard the echo after 2 s.What is the distance of the cliff from the\\nperson if the speed of the sound, v is\\ntaken as 346 m s–1?\\nSolution:\\nGiven,\\nSpeed of sound, v = 346 m s–1\\nTime taken for hearing the echo,\\nt = 2 s\\nDistance travelled by the sound\\n= v × t = 346 m s–1 × 2 s = 692 m\\nIn 2 s sound has to travel twice the\\ndistance between the cliff and the\\nperson.

V arieties or\\nstrains of cr ops can be selected by breeding\\nfor various useful characteristics such as\\ndisease r esistance, r esponse to fertilisers,\\nproduct quality and high yields. One way of\\nincorporating desirable characters into cr op\\nvarieties is by hybridisation. Hybridisation\\nrefers to cr ossing between genetically\\ndissimilar plants.

Baking quality is\\nimportant in wheat, pr otein quality in\\npulses, oil quality in oilseeds and\\npreserving quality in fruits and\\nvegetables.\\n•Biotic and abiotic r esistance: Cr ops\\nproduction can go down due to biotic\\n(diseases, insects and nematodes) and\\nabiotic (dr ought, salinity, water\\nlogging, heat, cold and fr ost) str esses\\nunder dif ferent situations. V arieties\\nresistant to these str esses can impr ove\\ncrop production.\\n•Change in maturity duration: The\\nshorter the duration of the cr op from\\nsowing to harvesting, the mor e\\neconomical is the variety. Such short\\ndurations allow far mers to gr ow\\nmultiple r ounds of cr ops in a year .\\nShort duration also r educes the cost\\nof crop pr\\noduction.

Different farmers thus have more\\nor less land, money and access to information\\nand technologies. In short, it is the money or\\nfinancial conditions that allow farmers to take\\nup different farming practices and agricultural\\ntechnologies. There is a correlation between\\nhigher inputs and yields. Thus, the farmer’s\\npurchasing capacity for inputs decides\\ncropping system and production practices.\\nTherefore, production practices can be at\\ndifferent levels. They include ‘no cost’\\nproduction, ‘low cost’ production and ‘high\\ncost’ production practices.\\n12.1.2 ( i)  NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT\\nJust as we need food for development, growth\\nand well-being, plants also require nutrients\\nfor growth. Nutrients are supplied to plants\\nby air , water and soil. Ther e are several\\nnutrients which are essential for plants. Air\\nsupplies carbon and oxygen, hydrogen comes\\nfrom water , and soil supplies the other thirteen\\nnutrients to plants. Amongst these, some are\\nrequired in large quantities and are therefore\\ncalled macro-nutrients.

Fertilizers are a factor in the higher\\nyields of high-cost far ming.\\nFertilizers should be applied car efully in\\nterms of pr oper dose, time, and observing pr e-\\nand post-application pr ecautions for their\\ncomplete utilisation. For example, sometimes\\nfertilizers get washed away due to excessive\\nirrigation and ar e not fully absorbed by the\\nplants. This excess fertilizer then leads to\\nwater pollution.\\nAlso, as we have seen in the pr evious\\nchapter , continuous use of fertilizers in an\\narea can destroy soil fertility because the\\norganic matter in the soil is not replenished\\nand micro-organisms in the soil are harmed\\nby the fertilizers used. Short-term benefits of\\nusing fertilizers and long-term benefits of usingDeficiency of these nutrients affects\\nphysiological processes in plants including\\nreproduction, growth and susceptibility to\\ndiseases.

Brackish water\\nresources, wher e seawater and fr esh water\\nmix together , such as estuaries and lagoons\\nare also important fish r eservoirs. While\\ncaptur e fishing is also done in such inland\\nwater bodies, the yield is not high. Most fish\\nproduction fr om these r esour\\nces is thr ough\\naquacultur e.\\nFish cultur e is sometimes done in\\ncombination with a rice cr op, so that fish ar e\\ngrown in the water in the paddy field. Mor e\\nintensive fish far ming can be done in\\ncomposite fish cultur e systems. Both local\\nand imported fish species ar e used in such\\nsystems.In such a system, a combination of five or\\nsix fish species is used in a single fishpond.\\nThese species ar e selected so that they do\\nnot compete for food among them having\\ndifferent types of food habits. As a r esult, the\\nfood available in all the parts of the pond is\\nused. As Catlas are sur face feeders, Rohus\\nfeed in the middle-zone of the pond, Mrigals\\nand Common Carps ar e bottom feeders, and\\nGrass Carps feed on the weeds, together these\\nspecies (Fig. 12.6) can use all the food in the\\npond without competing with each other .

This principle\\nmarks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape\\nour system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The\\nsyllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to\\nimplement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and\\nthe maintenance of sharp boundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope\\nthese measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-\\ncentred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to\\npursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must r ecognise that, given\\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\\nthe infor mation passed on to them by adults. T reating the pr escribed textbook\\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\\nand sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible\\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers\\nof a fixed body of knowledge.\\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching\\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular\\nburden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

Seasonal\\ncontrasts are more in the interior of the\\ncountry. There is decrease in rainfall generally\\nfrom east to west in the Northern Plains. These\\nvariations have given rise to variety in lives of\\npeople – in terms of the food they eat, the\\nclothes they wear and also the kind of houses\\nthey live in.\\n• Why the houses in Rajasthan have thick\\nwalls and flat roofs?\\n•  Why is it that the houses in the Tarai region and\\nin Goa and Mangalore have sloping roofs?\\n•Why houses in Assam are built on stilts?\\nCLIMATIC  CONTROLS\\nThere are six major controls of  the climate of\\nany place. They are: latitude , altitude ,\\npressure and wind system, distance from\\nthe sea (continentality), ocean currents and\\nrelief features .\\nDue to the curvature of the earth, the\\namount of solar energy received varies\\naccording to latitude . As a result, air\\ntemperature generally decreases from the\\nequator towards the poles. As one goes from\\nthe surface of the earth to higher altitudes ,\\nthe atmosphere becomes less dense and\\ntemperature decreases. The hills are therefore\\ncooler during summers. The pressure and\\nwind  system of any area depend on the\\nlatitude and altitude of the place. Thus it\\ninfluences the temperature and rainfall\\npattern. The sea exerts a moderating influence\\non climate:  As the distance from the sea\\nincreases, its moderating influence decreases\\nand the people experience extreme weather\\nconditions. This condition is known as\\ncontinentality (i.e. very hot during summers\\nand very cold during winters). Ocean currents\\nalong with onshore winds affect the climate of\\nthe coastal areas, For example, any coastal\\narea with warm or cold currents flowing past\\nit, will be warmed or cooled if the winds are\\nonshore.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

They blow southwards, get\\ndeflected to the right due to the Coriolis force,\\nand move  towards the equatorial low-pressure\\narea. Generally, these winds carry little\\nmoisture as they originate and blow over land.\\nTherefore, they bring little or no rain. Hence,\\nIndia should have been an arid land, but it is\\nnot so. Let us see why?\\nCoriolis force : An apparent force caused by the\\nearth’s rotation. The Coriolis force is responsible for\\ndeflecting winds towards the right in the northern\\nhemisphere and towards the left in the southern\\nhemisphere.  This is also known as ‘Ferrel’s Law’.\\nThe pressure and wind conditions over\\nIndia ar e unique. During winter , ther e is a\\nhigh-pressure area north of the Himalayas.\\nCold dry winds blow from this region to the\\nlow-pressure areas over the oceans to the\\nsouth. In summer , a low-pr essur e area\\ndevelops over interior Asia , as well as , over\\nnorthwester n India. This causes a complete\\nreversal of the direction of winds during\\nsummer . Air moves fr om the high-pr essur e\\narea over the southern Indian Ocean, in a\\nsouth-easterly dir ection, cr osses the equator ,\\nand turns right towards the low-pressure areas\\nover the Indian subcontinent. These are known\\nas the Southwest Monsoon winds. These winds\\nblow over the warm oceans, gather moisture\\nand bring widespread rainfall over the\\nmainland of India.\\nTHE SEASONS\\nThe monsoon type of climate is characterised\\nby a distinct seasonal pattern. The weather\\nconditions greatly  change from one season to\\nthe other . These changes ar e particularly\\nnoticeable in the interior parts of the country.\\nThe coastal areas do not experience much\\nvariation in temperature though there is\\nvariation in rainfall pattern. How many seasons\\nare experienced in your place? Four main\\nseasons can be identified in India – the cold\\nweather season, the hot weather season, theadvancing monsoon and the retreating\\nmonsoon with some regional variations.\\nThe Cold W eather Season (W inter)\\nThe cold weather season begins from mid-\\nNovember in northern India and stays till\\nFebruary. December and January are the\\ncoldest months in the northern part of India.\\nThe temperature decreases from south to the\\nnorth. The average temperature of Chennai, on\\nthe eastern coast, is between 24°– 25° Celsius,\\nwhile in the northern plains, it ranges between\\n10°C and 15° Celsius. Days are warm and\\nnights are cold. Frost is common in the north\\nand the higher slopes of the Himalayas\\nexperience snowfall.\\nDuring this season, the northeast trade\\nwinds prevail over the country. They blow from\\nland to sea and hence, for most part of the\\ncountry, it is a dry season. Some amount of\\nrainfall occurs on the Tamil Nadu coast from\\nthese winds as, here they blow from sea to land.\\nIn the northern part of the country, a feeble\\nhigh-pressure region develops, with light winds\\nmoving outwards from this area. Influenced by\\nthe relief, these winds blow through the Ganga\\nvalley from the west and the northwest. The\\nweather is normally marked by clear sky, low\\ntemperatures and low humidity and feeble,\\nvariable winds.\\nA characteristic feature of the cold weather\\nseason over the northern plains is the inflow of\\ncyclonic disturbances from the west and the\\nnorthwest. These low-pressure systems,\\noriginate over the Mediterranean Sea and\\nwestern Asia and move into India, along with\\nthe westerly flow. They cause the much-needed\\nwinter rains over the plains and snowfall in the\\nmountains. Although the total amount of\\nwinter rainfall locally known as \\n‘mahawat’  is\\nsmall, they are of immense importance for the\\ncultivation of ‘rabi’ crops.\\nThe peninsular region does not have a well-\\ndefined cold season. There is hardly any\\nnoticeable seasonal change in temperature\\npattern during winters due to the moderating\\ninfluence of the sea.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The influence of the shifting of\\nthe heat belt can be seen clearly from\\ntemperature recordings taken during March-\\nMay at different latitudes. In March, the highest\\ntemperature is about 38° Celsius, recorded on\\nthe Deccan plateau. In April, temperatures in\\nGujarat and Madhya Pradesh are around 42°\\nCelsius. In May, temperature of 45° Celsius is\\ncommon in the northwestern parts of the\\ncountry. In peninsular India, temperatures\\nremain lower due to the moderating influence\\nof the oceans.\\nThe summer months experience rising\\ntemperature and falling air pressure in the\\nnorthern part of the country. Towards the end\\nof May, an elongated low-pressure area\\ndevelops in the region extending from the Thar\\nDesert in the northwest to Patna and\\nChotanagpur plateau in the east and\\nsoutheast. Circulation of air begins to set in\\naround this trough.\\nA striking feature of the hot weather season\\nis the ‘loo’. These are strong, gusty, hot, dry\\nwinds blowing during the day over the north\\nand northwestern India. Sometimes they even\\ncontinue until late in the evening. Direct\\nexposure to these winds may even prove to be\\nfatal. Dust storms are very common during the\\nmonth of May in northern India. These storms\\nbring temporary relief as they lower the\\ntemperature and may bring light rain and cool\\nbreeze. This is also the season for localised\\nthunderstorms, associated with violent winds,\\ntorrential downpours, often accompanied by\\nhail. In W est Bengal, these stor ms ar e known\\nas the ‘ Kaal Baisakhi’ .\\nTowards the close of the summer season,\\npre-monsoon showers are common especially,\\nin Kerala and Karnataka. They help in the early\\nripening of mangoes, and are often referred to\\nas ‘mango showers’ .Advancing Monsoon (The Rainy Season)\\nBy early June, the low-pressure condition over\\nthe northern plains intensifies. It attracts, the\\ntrade winds of the southern hemisphere. These\\nsouth-east trade winds originate over the\\nwarm subtropical areas of the southern oceans.\\nThey cross the equator and blow in a south-\\nwesterly direction entering the Indian peninsula\\nas the south-west monsoon. As these winds\\nblow over warm oceans, they bring abundant\\nmoisture to the subcontinent. These winds are\\nstrong and blow at an average velocity of 30\\nkm per hour . With the exception of the extr eme\\nnorth-west, the monsoon winds cover the\\ncountry in about a month.\\nThe inflow of the south-west monsoon into\\nIndia brings about a total change in the\\nweather . Early in the season, the windwar d\\nside of the W estern Ghats r eceives very heavy\\nrainfall, more than 250 cm. The Deccan\\nPlateau and parts of Madhya Pradesh also\\nreceive some amount of rain in spite of lying\\nin the rain shadow area. The m aximum rainfall\\nof this season is received in the north-eastern\\npart of the country. Mawsynram in the\\nsouthern ranges of the Khasi Hills receive s the\\nhighest average rainfall in the world. Rainfall\\nin the Ganga valley decreases from the east to\\nthe west. Rajasthan and parts of Gujarat get\\nscanty rainfall.\\nAnother phenomenon associated with the\\nmonsoon is its tendency to have ‘breaks’ in\\nrainfall. Thus, it has wet and dry spells. In\\nother words, the monsoon rains take place\\nonly for a few days at a time. They are\\ninterspersed with rainless intervals. These\\nbreaks in monsoon are related to the\\nmovement of the monsoon trough. For\\nvarious reasons, the trough and its axis keep\\non moving northward or southward, which\\ndetermines the spatial distribution of rainfall.\\nWhen the axis of the monsoon trough lies over\\nthe plains, rainfall is good in these parts. On\\nthe other hand, whenever the axis shifts closer\\nto the Himalayas, there are longer dry spells\\nin the plains, and widespread rain occur in\\nthe mountainous catchment areas of the\\nHimalayan rivers.

Since 1981, birth\\nrates have also started declining gradually,\\nresulting in a gradual decline in the rate of\\npopulation growth. What are the reasons for\\nthis trend?\\nThe third component of population growth\\nis migration . Migration is the movement of\\npeople across regions and territories. Migration\\ncan be internal  (within the country) or\\ninternational (between the countries).\\nInternal migration does not change the size\\nof the population, but influences the\\ndistribution of population within the nation.\\nMigration plays a very significant role in\\nchanging the composition and distribution of\\npopulation.population in 1951 to 31.80 per cent in 2011.\\nThere has been a significant increase in the\\nnumber of ‘million plus cities’ from 35 to 53 in\\njust one decade, i.e., 2001 to 2011. In 2023\\nthere were 59 million plus cities in India.\\nAdolescent Population\\nThe most significant feature of the Indian\\npopulation is the size of its adolescent\\npopulation.  It constitutes one-fifth of the total\\npopulation of India.  Adolescents are,\\ngenerally, grouped in the age group of 10 to\\n19 years.  They are the most important\\nresource for the future.  Nutrition\\nrequirements of adolescents are higher than\\nthose of a normal child or adult.  Poor nutrition\\ncan lead to deficiency and stunted growth.\\nBut in India,  the diet available to adolescents\\nis inadequate in all nutrients. A large number\\nof adolescent girls suffer from anaemia. Their\\nproblems have so far not received adequate\\nattention in the process of development.  The\\nadolescent girls have to be sensitised to the\\nproblems they confront.  Awareness among\\nthem can be improved through the spread of\\nliteracy and education .\\nNational Population Policy\\nRecognising that the planning of families\\nwould improve individual health and\\nwelfare, the Government of India initiated  a\\ncomprehensive Family Planning Programme\\nin 1952. The Family W elfare Programme has\\nsought to promote responsible and planned\\nparenthood on a voluntary basis. The National\\nPopulation Policy (N PP) 2000 is a\\nculmination of years of planned efforts.\\nThe NPP 2000 provides a policy\\nframework for imparting free and compulsory\\nschool education up to 14 years of age,\\nreducing infant mortality rate to below 30 per\\n1000 live births, achieving universal\\nimmunisation of children against all vaccine\\npreventable diseases, promoting delayed\\nmarriage for girls, and making family welfare\\na people-centred programme.Activity\\nOn a map, trace the migration of each\\nof your grandparents and parents\\nsince their birth. Try and analyse the\\nreasons for each move.\\nIn India, most migrations have been from\\nrural to urban areas because of the “push”\\nfactor in rural areas. These are adverse\\nconditions of poverty and unemployment in the\\nrural areas and the “pull” of the city in terms\\nof increased employment opportunities and\\nbetter living conditions.\\nMigration is an important determinant of\\npopulation change. It changes not only the\\npopulation size but also the population\\ncomposition of urban and rural populations\\nin terms of age and sex composition.

This principle\\nmarks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to\\nshape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community.\\nThe syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to\\nimplement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and\\nthe maintenance of sharp boundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope\\nthese measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred\\nsystem of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and\\nto pursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must r ecognise that, given\\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\\nthe infor mation passed on to them by adults. T reating the pr escribed textbook\\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\\nand sites of learning are ignored. Including creativity and initiative is possible\\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers\\nof a fixed body of knowledge.\\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\\nimplementing the annual  calendar so that the required number of teaching\\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular\\nburden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority\\nand space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in\\nsmall groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\\nThe National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining (NCER T)\\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\\nresponsible for this book.

These\\nproduction activities need various types\\nof resources — natural resources, man-\\nmade items, human effort, money, etc. As\\nwe read through the story of Palampur ,\\nwe will learn how various resources\\ncombine to produce the desired goods and\\nservices in the village.\\nIntroduction\\nPalampur is well-connected with\\nneighbouring villages and towns. Raiganj,\\na big village, is 3 kms from Palampur . An\\nall weather road connects the village to\\nRaiganj and further on to the nearest\\nsmall town of Shahpur . Many kinds of\\ntransport are visible on this road starting\\nfrom bullock carts, tongas , bogeys (wooden\\ncart drawn by buffalos) loaded with jaggery\\n(gur) and other commodities to motor\\nvehicles like motorcycles, jeeps, tractors\\nand trucks.\\nThis village has about 450 families\\nbelonging to several different castes. The\\n80 upper caste families own the majority\\nof land in the village. Their houses, some\\nof them quite large, are made of brick with\\ncement plastering. The SCs (dalits)\\ncomprise one third of the population and\\nlive in one corner of the village and in\\nmuch smaller houses some of which are\\nof mud and straw. Most of the houses haveelectric connections. Electricity powers all\\nthe tubewells in the fields and is used in\\nvarious types of small business. Palampur\\nhas two primary schools and one high\\nschool. There is a primary health centre\\nrun by the government and one private\\ndispensary where the sick are treated.\\n•The description above shows that\\nPalampur has fairly well-developed\\nsystem of roads, transport, electricity,\\nirrigation, schools and health centre.\\nCompare these facilities with those in\\nyour nearby village.\\nThe story of Palampur , an imaginary\\nvillage, will take us through the different\\ntypes of production activities in the\\nvillage. In villages across India, farming\\nis the main production activity. The other\\nproduction activities, referred to as non-\\nfarm activities include small\\nmanufacturing, transport, shop-keeping,\\netc. W e shall take a lo ok at both these\\ntypes of activities, after learning a few\\ngeneral things about production.The Story of Village PalampurThe Story of Village Palampur1\\nChapter1\\nPicture 1.1  Scene of a village\\n*The narrative is partly based on a research study by G ilbert Etienne of a village in Bulandshahr district in W estern\\nUttar Pradesh.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'class9\\\\combined_3.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='2   \\n   EconomicsOrganisation of Production\\nThe aim of production is to produce the\\ngoods and services that we want. There\\nare four requirements for production of\\ngoods and services.\\nThe first requirement is land , and\\nother natural resources such as water ,\\nforests, minerals.\\nThe second requirement is labour , i.e.\\npeople who will do the work. Some\\nproduction activities require highly\\neducated workers to perform the\\nnecessary tasks. Other activities require\\nworkers who can do manual work. Each\\nworker is providing the labour necessary\\nfor production.\\nThe third requirement is physical\\ncapital , i.e. the variety of inputs required\\nat every stage during production. What\\nare the items that come under physical\\ncapital?\\n(a) Tools, machines, buildings:  Tools and\\nmachines range from very simple tools\\nsuch as a farmer’s plough to\\nsophisticated machines such as\\ngenerators, turbines, computers, etc.\\nTools, machines, buildings can be used\\nin production over many years, and\\nare called fixed capital.\\n(b) Raw materials and money in hand:\\nProduction requires a variety of raw\\nmaterials such as the yarn used by\\nthe weaver and the clay used by the\\npotter . Also, some money is always\\nrequired during production to make\\npayments and buy other necessary\\nitems. Raw materials and money in\\nhand are called working capital .\\nUnlike tools, machines and buildings,\\nthese are used up in production.\\nThere is a fourth requirement to o. You\\nwill need knowledge and enterprise to be\\nable to put together land, labour and\\nphysical capital and produce an output\\neither to use yourself or to sell in the\\nmarket. This these days is called humancapital. W e shall learn more about human\\ncapital  in the next chapter .\\n•In the picture, identify the land, labour\\nand fixed capital used in production.\\nPicture 1.2 A factory, with several  labourers\\nand  machines\\nEvery production is organised by\\ncombining land, labour , physical capital\\nand human capital, which are known as\\nfactors of production . As we read\\nthrough the story of Palampur , we will\\nlearn more about the first three factors\\nof production. For convenience, we will\\nrefer to the physical capital as the capital\\nin this chapter .\\nFarming in Palampur\\n1.Land is fixed\\nFarming is the main production activity\\nin Palampur . 75 per cent of the people\\nwho are working are dependent on\\nfarming for their livelihood. They could\\nbe farmers or farm labourers. The well-\\nbeing of these people is closely related to\\nproduction on the farms.\\nBut remember that there is a basic\\nconstraint in raising farm production.\\nLand area under cultivation is practically\\nfixed.

By then, some of the\\nwastelands in the village had been\\nconverted to cultivable land. There exists\\nno further scope to increase farm\\nproduction by bringing new land under\\ncultivation.larger areas of land more effectively. The\\nfirst few tubewells were installed by the\\ngovernment. So on, however , farmers\\nstarted setting up private tubewells. As a\\nresult, by mid-1970s the entire cultivated\\narea of 200 hectares (ha.) was irrigated.\\nThe standard unit of measuring land\\nis hectare, though in the villages you\\nmay find land area being discussed\\nin local units such as bigha, guintha\\netc. One hectare equals the area of a\\nsquare with one side measuring 100\\nmetres.  Can you compare the area of\\na 1 hectare field with the area of your\\nschool ground?\\n2.Is there a way one can grow more\\nfrom the same land?\\nIn the kind of crops grown and facilities\\navailable, Palampur would resemble a\\nvillage of the western part of the state of\\nUttar Pradesh. All land is cultivated in\\nPalampur . No land is left idle. During the\\nrainy season (kharif) farmers grow jowar\\nand bajra. These plants are used as cattle\\nfeed. It is followed by cultivation of potato\\nbetwe en October and December . In the\\nwinter season (rabi), fields are sown with\\nwheat. From the wheat produced, farmers\\nkeep enough wheat for the family’s\\nconsumption and sell the surplus wheat\\nat the market at Raiganj. A part of the\\nland area is also devoted to sugarcane\\nwhich is harvested once every year .\\nSugarcane, in its raw form, or as jaggery,\\nis sold to traders in Shahpur .\\nThe main reason why farmers are able\\nto grow three different crops in a year in\\nPalampur is due to the well-developed\\nsystem of irrigation. Electricity came early\\nto Palampur . Its major impact was to\\ntransform the system of irrigation.\\nPersian wheels were, till then, used by\\nfarmers to draw water from the wells and\\nirrigate small fields. People saw that the\\nelectric-run tubewells could irrigat e muchNot all villages in India have such\\nhigh levels of irrigation.  Apart from\\nthe riverine plains, coastal regions in\\nour country are well-irrigated.  In\\ncontrast, plateau regions such as the\\nDeccan plateau have low levels of\\nirrigation.  Of the total cultivated area\\nin the country a little less than 40\\nper cent is irrigated even today.  In\\nthe remaining areas, farming is\\nlargely dependent on rainfall.\\nTo grow more than one crop on a piece of\\nland during the year is known as multiple\\ncropping. It is the most common way of\\nincreasing production on a given piece of\\nland.

Out of a total of 850\\nhouseholds in the two villages, there\\nare more than 250 men who are\\nemployed in rural Punjab and Haryana\\nor in Delhi, Mumbai, Surat, Hyderabad\\nor Nagpur . Such migration is common\\nin most villages across India. Why do\\npeople migrate? Can you describe\\n(based on your imagination) the work\\nthat the migrants of Gosaipur and\\nMajauli might do at the place of\\ndestination?\\n6.The capital needed in farming\\nYou ha ve already se en that the modern\\nfarming methods require a great deal of\\ncapital, so that the farmer now needs\\nmore money than before.\\n1.Most small farmers have to borrow\\nmoney to arrange for the capital. They\\nborrow from large farmers or the\\nvillage moneylenders or the traders\\nwho supply various inputs for\\ncultivation. The rate of interest on\\nsuch loans is very high. They are put\\nto great distress  to repay the loan.\\nSavita is a small farmer . She plans\\nto cultivate wheat on her 1 hectare of\\nland. Besides seeds, fertilizers and\\npesticides, she needs cash to buy\\nwater and repair her farm\\ninstruments. She estimates that the\\nworking capital itself would cost a\\nminimum of Rs 3,000. She doesn’t\\nhave the money, so she decides to\\nborrow from Tejpal Singh, a largefarmer . Tejpal Singh agre es to give\\nSavita the loan at an interest rate of\\n24 per cent for four months, which is\\na very high interest rate. Savita also\\nhas to promise to work on his field as\\na farm labourer during the harvest\\nseason at Rs 100 per day. As you can\\ntell, this wage is quite low. Savita\\nknows that she will have to work very\\nhard to complete harvesting on her\\nown field, and then work as a farm\\nlabourer for Tejpal Singh. The harvest\\ntime is a very busy time. As a mother\\nof three children she has a lot of\\nhousehold responsibilities. Savita\\nagrees to these tough conditions as\\nshe knows getting a loan is difficult\\nfor a small farmer .\\n2.In contrast to the small farmers, the\\nmedium and large farmers have their\\nown savings from farming. They are\\nthus able to arrange for the capital\\nneeded. How do these farmers have\\ntheir own savings? Y ou shall find the\\nanswer in the next section.\\n  Let's discuss the story so far ....\\nWe have read about the thre e factors of\\nproduction—land, labour and capital—\\nand how they are used in farming. Let us\\nfill in the blanks given below.\\nAmong the three factors of production,\\nwe found that labour is the most\\nabundant factor of production. There are\\nmany people who are willing to work as\\nfarm labourers in the villages, whereas\\nthe opportunities of work are limited. They\\nbelong to either landless families or\\n. They are paid low wages,\\nand lead a difficult life.\\nIn contrast to labour , \\nis a scarce factor of production. Cultivated\\nland area is . Moreover ,\\neven the existing land is distributed\\n (equally/unequally)  among\\nthe people engaged in farming.

Small\\nfarmers usually need to borrow money to\\narrange for the capital, and are put to\\ngreat distress to repay the loan. Therefore,\\ncapital too is a scarce factor of production,\\nparticularly for the small farmers.\\nThough both land and capital are\\nscarce, there is a basic difference between\\nthe two factors of production.\\n is a natural resource,\\nwhereas  is man-made. It\\nis possible to increase capital, whereas\\nland is fixed. Therefore, it is very\\nimportant that we take good care of land\\nand other natural resources used in\\nfarming.\\n7.Sale of Surplus Farm Products\\nLet us suppose that the farmers have\\nproduced wheat on their lands using the\\nthree factors of production. The wheat\\nis harvested and production is complete.\\nWhat do the farmers do with the wheat?\\nThey retain a part of the wheat for the\\nfamily’s consumption and sell the\\nsurplus wheat. Small farmers like\\nSavita and Gobind’s sons have little\\nsurplus wheat because their total\\nproduction is small and from this a\\nsubstantial share is kept for their own\\nfamily needs. So it is the medium and\\nlarge farmers who supply wheat to the\\nmarket. In the  Picture  1.1, you can see the\\nbullock cart streaming into the market\\neach carrying loads of wheat. The traders\\nat the market buy the wheat and sell it\\nfurther to shopkeepers in the towns and\\ncities .Tejpal Singh, the large farmer , has a\\nsurplus of 350 quintals of wheat from all\\nhis lands! He sells the surplus wheat at\\nthe Raiganj market and has good earnings.\\nWhat does Tejpal Singh do with his\\nearnings? L ast year , Tejpal Singh had put\\nmost of the money in his bank account.\\nLater he used the savings for lending to\\nfarmers like Savita who were in need of a\\nloan. He also used the savings to arrange\\nfor the working capital for farming in the\\nnext season. This year Tejpal Singh plans\\nto use his earnings to buy another tractor .\\nAnother tractor would increase his fixed\\ncapital.\\nLike Tejpal Singh, other large and\\nmedium farmers sell the surplus farm\\nproducts. A part of the earnings is saved\\nand kept for buying capital for the next\\nseason. Thus, they are able to arrange\\nfor the capital for farming from their own\\nsavings. Some farmers might also use the\\nsavings to buy cattle, trucks, or to set up\\nshops. As we shall see, these constitute\\nthe capital for non-farm activities.\\nNon-Farm Activities in Palampur\\nWe have learnt about farming as the main\\nproduction activity in Palampur . We shall\\nnow take a look at some of the non-farm\\nproduction activities. Only 25 per cent\\nof the people working in Palampur are\\nengaged in activities other than\\nagriculture.\\n1.Dairy — the other common\\nactivity\\nDairy is a common activity in many families\\nof Palampur .

Every month he gets some\\nwork in transport. As a result, Kishora\\nis able to earn more than what he used\\nto do some years back.\\n Summary\\nFarming is the main production activity in the village. Over the years there have\\nbeen many important changes in the way farming is practiced. These have allowed\\nthe farmers to produce more crops from the same amount of land. This is an\\nimportant achievement, since land is fixed and scarce. But in raising production\\na great deal of pressure has been put on land and other natural resources.\\nThe new ways of farming need less land, but much more of capital. The medium\\nand large farmers are able to use their own savings from production to arrange\\nfor capital during the next season. On the other hand, the small farmers who\\nconstitute about 80 per cent of total farmers in India, find it difficult to obtain\\ncapital. Because of the small size of their plots, their production is not enough.\\nThe lack of surplus means that they are unable to obtain capital from their own\\nsavings, and have to borrow. Besides the debt, many of the small farmers have\\nto do additional work as farm labourers to feed themselves and their families.\\nLabour being the most abundant factor of production, it would be ideal if\\nnew ways of farming used much more labour . Unfortunately , such a thing has\\nnot happened. The use of labour on farms is limited. The labour , looking for\\nopportunities is thus migrating to neighbouring villages, towns and cities. Some\\nlabour has entered the non-farm sector in the village.\\nAt present, the non-farm sector in the village is not very large. Out of every\\n100 workers in the rural areas in India, only 24 are engaged in non-farm activities.\\nThough there is a variety of non-farm activities in the villages (we have only\\nseen a few examples), the number of people employed in each is quite small.\\nIn the future, one would like to see more non-farm production activities in the\\nvillage. Unlike farming, non-farm activities require little land. People with some\\namount of capital can set up non-farm activities. How does one obtain this capital?\\nOne can either use his own savings, but more often has to take a loan. It is\\nimportant that loan be available at low rate of interest so that even people without\\nsavings can start some non-farm activity. Another thing which is essential for\\nexpansion of non-farm activities is to have markets where the goods and services\\nproduced can be sold. I n Palampur , we saw the neighbouring villages, towns and\\ncities provide the markets for milk, jaggery, wheat, etc. As more villages get\\nconnected to towns and cities through good roads, transport and telephone, it is\\npossible that the opportunities for non-farm activities  in the village would increase\\nin the coming years.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

Looking at the\\npopulation from this productive aspect\\nemphasises its ability to contribute to\\nthe creation of the Gross National\\nProduct. Like other resources population\\nalso is a resource — a 'hum an resource '.\\nThis is the positive side of a large\\npopulation that is often overlooked when\\nwe look only at the negative side,\\nconsidering only the problems of\\nproviding the population with food,\\neducation and access to health facilities.\\nWhen the existing 'human resource ' is\\nfurther developed by becoming more\\neducated and healthy, we call it 'human\\ncapital formation ' that adds to the\\nproductive power of the country just like\\n'physical capital formation '.\\nInvestment in human capital\\n(through education, training, medical\\ncare) yields a return just like investment\\nin physical capital. This can be seen\\ndirectly in the form of higher incomes\\nearned because of higher productivity\\nof the more educated or the better trained\\npersons, as well as the higher\\nproductivity of healthier people.People as Resource2\\nChapter\\nIndia’s Green Revolution is a\\ndramatic example of how the input\\nof greater knowledge in the form of\\nimproved production technologies can\\nrapidly increase the productivity of\\nscarce land resources.

Buta and Sheela were\\neager to teach Sakal. They forced him\\nto join the village school which he\\nsoon joined. He started studying and\\ncompleted his higher secondary\\nexamination. His father persuaded\\nhim to continue his studies. He raised\\na loan for Sakal to study a vocational\\ncourse in computers. Sakal was\\nmeritorious and interested in studies\\nfrom the beginning. With great vigour\\nand enthusiasm he completed his\\ncourse. After some time he got a job\\nin a private firm. He even designed a\\nnew kind of software.

His father passed away\\nwhen he was only two years old. His\\nmother Geeta sold fish to earn money\\nto feed the family. She bought fish\\nfrom the landowner’s pond and sold\\nit in the nearby mandi .

This investment\\non people is the same as investment in\\nland and capital.\\nA child, too, with investments made\\non her education and health, can yield\\na high return in future in the form of\\nhigher earnings and greater\\ncontribution to the society. Educated\\nparents are found to invest more heavily\\non the education of their child. This is\\nbecause they have realised the\\nimportance of education for themselves.\\nThey are also conscious of proper\\nnutrition and hygiene. They accordingly\\nlook after their children’s needs for\\neducation at school and good health. A\\nvirtuous cycle is, thus, created in this\\ncase. In contrast, a vicious cycle may\\nbe created by disadvantaged parents,\\nwho themselves uneducated and lacking\\nin hygiene, keep their children in a\\nsimilarly disadvantaged state.\\nCountries, like Japan, have invested\\nin human resource. They did not have any\\nnatural resource. These countries are\\ndeveloped/rich. They import the natural\\nresource needed in their country. How did\\nthey become rich/developed? They have\\ninvested on people, especially in the field\\nof education and health. These people\\nhave made efficient use of other resources,\\nlike land and capital.

W e saw that\\nVilas sold fish and Sakal got a job in the\\nfirm. The various activities have been\\nclassified into three main sectors i.e.,\\nprimary, secondary and tertiary.

Trade, transport,\\ncommunication, banking, education,\\nhealth, tourism, services, insurance, etc.\\nare included in the tertiary sector . The\\nactivities in this sector result in the\\nproduction of goods and services. These\\nactivities add value to the national\\nincome. These activities are called\\neconomic activities.

Inability of educated people who\\nare willing to work to find gainful\\nemployment implies a great social waste.\\nUnemployment tends to increase\\neconomic overload. The dependence of the\\nunemployed on the working population\\nincreases. The quality of life of an\\nindividual as well as of society is adversely\\naffected. When a family has to live on a\\nbare subsistence level there is a general\\ndecline in its health status and rising\\nwithdrawal from the school system.\\nHence, unemployment has detrimental\\nimpact on the overall growth of an\\neconomy. Increase in unemployment is an\\nindicator of a depressed economy. It also\\nwastes the resource, which could have\\nbeen gainfully employed.

One\\nof the families decided to send one of\\nits sons to an agriculture college. The\\nboy got his admission in the nearby\\ncollege of agriculture. After some time\\nhe became qualified in agro-\\nengineering and came back to the\\nvillage. He proved to be so creative\\nthat he could design an improved\\ntype of plough, which increased the\\nyield of wheat. Thus a new job of agro-\\nengineer was created and filled in the\\nvillage. The family in the village sold\\nthe surplus in a nearby neighbouring\\nvillage. They earned good profit,\\nwhich they shared among\\nthemselves. Inspired by this success\\nall the families after some time held\\na meeting in the village. They all\\nwanted to have a better future for\\ntheir children too. They requested the\\npanchayat to open a school in the\\nvillage. They assured the panchayat\\nthat they would all send their\\nchildren to school. The panchayat,\\nwith the help of government, opened\\na school. A teacher was recruited\\nfrom a nearby town.

Poverty also means lack\\nof clean water and sanitation facilities. It\\nalso means lack of a regular job at a\\nminimum decent level. Above all it means\\nliving with a sense of helplessness.

Usually the indicators used\\nrelate to the levels of income and\\nconsumption. But now poverty is looked\\nthrough other social indicators like\\nilliteracy level, lack of general resistance\\ndue to malnutrition, lack of access to\\nhealthcare, lack of job opportunities, lack\\nof access to safe drinking water ,\\nsanitation etc. Analysis of poverty based\\non social exclusion and vulnerability is\\nnow becoming very common (see box).both a cause as well as a\\nconsequence of poverty in the usual\\nsense. Broadly, it is a process through\\nwhich individuals or groups are\\nexcluded from facilities, benefits and\\nopportunities that others (their\\n“betters”) enjoy. A typical example is\\nthe working of the caste system in\\nIndia in which people belonging to\\ncertain castes are excluded from\\nequal opportunities. Social exclusion\\nthus may lead to, but can cause more\\ndamage than, having a very low\\nincome.\\nVulnerability\\nVulnerability  to poverty is a measure,\\nwhich describes the greater\\nprobability of certain communities\\n(say, members of a backward caste)\\nor individuals (such as a widow or a\\nphysically handicapped person) of\\nbecoming, or remaining, poor in the\\ncoming years. V ulnerability is\\ndetermined by the options available\\nto different communities for finding\\nan alternative living in terms of\\nassets, education, health and job\\nopportunities. F urther , it is analysed\\non the basis of the greater risks these\\ngroups face at the time of natural\\ndisasters (earthquakes, tsunami),\\nterrorism etc. Additional analysis is\\nmade of their social and economic\\nability to handle these risks. In fact,\\nvulnerability describes the greater\\nprobability of being more adversely\\naffected than other people when bad\\ntime comes for everybody, whether a\\nflood or an earthquake or simply a\\nfall in the availability of jobs!Social exclusion\\nAccording to this concept, poverty\\nmust be seen in terms of the poor\\nhaving to live only in a poor\\nsurrounding with other poor people,\\nexcluded from enjoying social equality\\nof better -off people in better\\nsurroundings.

A person is\\nconsidered poor if his or her income or\\nconsumption level falls below a given\\n“minimum level” necessary to fulfill the\\nbasic needs. What is necessary to satisfy\\nthe basic needs is different at different\\ntimes and in different countries.\\nTherefore, poverty line may vary with time\\nand place. Each country uses an\\nimaginary line that is considered\\nappropriate for its existing level of\\ndevelopment and its accepted minimum\\nsocial norms. For example, a person not\\nhaving a car in the United States may be\\nconsidered po or. In India, owning of a car\\nis still considered a luxury.\\nWhile determining the poverty line in\\nIndia, a minimum level of food requirement,\\nclothing, fo otwear , fuel and light,\\neducational and medical requirement, etc.,\\nare determ ined for subsistence. These\\nphysical quantities are multiplied by their\\nprices in rupees. The present formula for\\nfood requirement while estimating the\\npoverty line is based on the desired\\ncalorie requirement. Food items, such as\\ncereals, pulses, vegetable, milk, oil, sugar ,\\netc., together provide these needed\\ncalories . The calorie needs vary depending\\non age, sex and the type of work that a\\nperson does. The accepted average calorie\\nrequirement in India is 2400 calories per\\nperson per day in rural areas and 2100\\ncalories per person per day in urban\\nareas. Since people living in rural areas\\nengage themselves in more physical work,\\ncalorie requirements in rural areas are\\nconsidered to be higher than in urban\\nareas. The monetary expenditure per\\ncapita needed for buying these calorie\\nrequirements in terms of food grains, etc.,\\nis revised periodically taking into\\nconsideration the rise in prices.\\nOn the basis of these calculations, for\\nthe year 2011–12, the poverty line for a\\nperson was fixed at Rs 816 per month for\\nrural areas and Rs 1000 for urban areas.\\nDespite less calorie requirement,thehigher amo unt for urban areas has been\\nfixed because of high prices of many\\nessential products in urban centres. In\\nthis way in the year 2011-12, a family of\\nfive members living in rural areas and\\nearning less than about Rs 4,080 per\\nmonth will be below the poverty line. A\\nsimilar family in the urban areas would\\nneed a minimum of Rs 5,000 per month\\nto meet their basic requirements. The\\npoverty line is estimated periodically\\n(normally every five years) by conducting\\nsample surveys. These surveys are\\ncarried out by the National Sample Survey\\nOrganisation (N SSO). H owever , for\\nmaking comparisons between developing\\ncountries, many international\\norganisations like the W orld Bank use a\\nuniform standard for the poverty line:\\nminimum availability of the equivalent of\\n$1.90 per person per day (2011, ppp).\\n  Let’s Discuss\\nDiscuss the following:\\n•Why do different countries use different\\npoverty lines?\\n•What do you think would be the\\n“minimum necessary level” in your\\nlocality ?\\nPoverty Estimates\\nIt is clear from Table 3.1 that there is a\\nsubstantial decline in poverty ratios in\\nIndia from about 45 per cent in 1993-94\\nto 37.2 per cent in 2004–05. The\\nproportion of people below poverty line\\nfurther came down to about 22 per cent\\nin 2011–12.

One\\nhistorical reason is the low level of\\neconomic development under the British\\ncolonial administration. The policies of\\nthe colonial government ruined traditional\\nhandicrafts and discouraged development\\nof industries like textiles. The low rate of\\ngrowth persisted until the nineteen-\\neighties. This resulted in less job\\nopportunities and low growth rate of\\nincomes. This was accompanied by a high\\ngrowth rate of population. The two\\ncombined to make the growth rate of per\\ncapita income very low. The failure at both\\nthe fronts: promotion of economic growth\\nand population control perpetuated the\\ncycle of poverty.\\nWith the spread of irrigation and the\\nGreen revolution, many job opportunities\\nwere created in the agriculture sector . But\\nthe effects were limited to some parts of\\nIndia. The industries, both in the public\\nand the private sector , did provide some\\njobs. But these were not enough to absorb\\nall the job seekers. Unable to find proper\\njobs in cities, many people started working\\nas rickshaw pullers, vendors,\\nconstruction workers, domestic servants\\netc. With irregular small incomes, these\\npeople could not afford expensive housing.\\nThey started living in slums on the\\noutskirts of the cities and the problems\\nof poverty, largely a rural phenomenon\\nalso became the feature of the urban\\nsector .\\nAnother feature of high poverty rates\\nhas been the huge income inequalities.\\nOne of the major reasons for this is the\\nunequal distribution of land and other\\nresources. Despite many policies, we have\\nnot been able to tackle the issue in a\\nmeaningful manner . Major policy\\ninitiatives like land reforms which aimed\\nat redistribution of assets in rural areas\\nhave not been implemented properly andeffectively by most of the state\\ngovernments. Since lack of land resources\\nhas been one of the major causes of\\npoverty in India, proper implementation\\nof policy could have improved the life of\\nmillions of rural po or.\\n Many other socio-cultural and\\neconomic factors also are responsible for\\npoverty. In order to fulfil social obligations\\nand observe religious ceremonies, people\\nin India, including the very po or, spend a\\nlot of money. Small farmers need money\\nto buy agricultural inputs like seeds,\\nfertilizer , pesticides etc. Since po or people\\nhardly have any savings, they borrow.\\nUnable to repay because of poverty, they\\nbecome victims of indebtedness. So the\\nhigh level of indebtedness is both the\\ncause and effect of poverty.\\nAnti-Poverty Measures\\nRemoval of poverty has been one of the\\nmajor objectives of Indian developmental\\nstrategy. The current anti-poverty\\nstrategy of the government is based\\nbroadly on two planks (1) promotion of\\neconomic growth (2) targeted anti-poverty\\nprogrammes.\\nOver a period of thirty years lasting\\nup to the early eighties, there were little\\nper capita income growth and not much\\nreduction in poverty. Official poverty\\nestimates which were about 45 per cent\\nin the early 1950s remained the same even\\nin the early eighties. Since the eighties,\\nIndia’s economic growth has been one of\\nthe fastest in the world. The growth rate\\njumped from the average of about 3.5 per\\ncent a year in the 1970s to about 6 per\\ncent during the 1980s and 1990s. The\\nhigher growth rates have helped\\nsignificantly in the reduction of poverty.\\nTherefore, it is becoming clear that there\\nis a strong link between economic growth\\nand poverty reduction. Economic growth\\nwidens opportunities and provides the\\nresources needed to invest in human\\ndevelopment. This also encourages people\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

H owever , the po or may not\\nbe able to take direct advantage from the\\nopportunities created by economic\\ngrowth. M oreover , growth in the\\nagriculture sector is much below\\nexpectations. This has a direct bearing\\non poverty as a large number of poor\\npeople live in villages and are dependent\\non agriculture.\\nIn these circumstances, there is a\\nclear need for targeted anti-poverty\\nprogrammes. A lthough there are so many\\nschemes which are formulated to af fect\\npoverty directly or indirectly , some of\\nthem are worth mentioning. Mahatma\\nGandhi National Rural Employment\\nGuarantee  Act, 2005 aims to provide 100\\ndays of wage employment to every\\nhousehold to ensure livelihood security\\nin rural areas. I t also aimed at sustainable\\ndevelopment to address the cause of\\ndraught, deforestration and soil erosion.\\nOne-third of the proposed jobs have been\\nreserved for women. The scheme provided\\nemployment to 220 crores person days of\\nemployment to 4.78 crore households.\\nThe share of SC , ST, Women person days\\nin the scheme are 23 per cent, 17 per\\ncent and 53 per cent respectively . The\\naverage wage has increased from 65 in\\n2006–07 to 132 in 2013–14. Recently , in\\nMarch 2018, the wage rate for unskilled\\nmanual workers has been revised, state\\nwise, the range of wage rate for dif ferent\\nstates and union territories lies in\\nbetween ` 281 per day (for the workers in\\nHaryana) to ` 168 per day  (for the workers\\nof Bihar and J harkhan d).\\nPrime Minister Rozgar Yozana (PMRY)\\nis another scheme which was started in\\n1993. The aim of the programme is to\\ncreate self-employment opportunitiesfor educated unemployed youth in rural\\nareas and small towns. They are helped in\\nsetting up small business  and industries.\\nRural Employment Generation Programme\\n(REG P) was launched in 1995. The aim of\\nthe programme is to create self-\\nemployment opportunities in rural areas\\nand small towns. A target for creating 25\\nlakh new jobs has been set for the\\nprogramme under the T enth F ive Y ear\\nplan. Swarnajayanti Gram Swarozgar\\nYojana (SG SY) was launched in 1999. The\\nprogramme aims at bringing the assisted\\npoor families above the poverty line by\\norganising them into self help groups\\nthrough a mix of bank credit and\\ngovernment subsidy . Under the Pradhan\\nMantri Gramodaya Yozana  (PM GY)\\nlaunched in 2000 , additional central\\nassistance is given to states for basic\\nservices such as primary health, primary\\neducation, rural shelter , rural drinking\\nwater and rural electrification.  Another\\nimportant scheme is Antyodaya Anna\\nYozana (AAY) about which you will be\\nreading more in the next chapter .\\nThe results of these programmes have\\nbeen mixed. One of the major reasons\\nfor less ef fectiveness is the lack of proper\\nimplementation and right targeting.\\nMoreover , there has be en a lot of\\noverlapping of schemes. Despite good\\nintentions, the benefits of these schemes\\nare not fully reached to the deserving\\npoor. Therefore, the major emphasis in\\nrecent years is on proper monitoring of\\nall the poverty alleviation programmes.\\nThe Challenges Ahead\\nPoverty has certainly declined in India.\\nBut despite the progress, poverty\\nreduction remains I ndia’ s most\\ncompelling challenge.

There are\\nabout 5.5 lakh  ration  shops  all over the\\ncountry. Ration shops also , known as\\nFair Price Shops , keep stock of\\nfoodgrains, sugar , and  kerosene for\\ncooking. These items are sold to people\\nat a price lower than the market price.\\nAny family with a ration card* can buy a\\nstipulated amount of these items (e.g. 35\\nkg of grains, 5 litres of kerosene, 5 kgs of\\nsugar etc.) every month from the nearby\\nration shop.Are there any problems that they face?\\nWhy are ration shops necessary?\\nThe introduction of Rationing  in India\\ndates back to the 1940s against the\\nbackdrop of the Bengal famine. The\\nrationing system was revived in the wake\\nof an acute food shortage during the\\n1960s, prior to the Green Revolution. In\\nthe wake of the high incidence of poverty\\nlevels, as reported by the NSSO in the\\nmid-1970s, three important food\\nintervention programmes were\\nintroduced: Public Distribution System\\n(PDS) for food grains (in existence earlier\\nbut strengthened thereafter); Integrated\\nChild Development Services (ICDS)\\n(introduced in 1975 on an experimental\\nbasis) and Food-for -Work** (FFW)\\n(introduced in 1977–78). Over the years,\\nseveral new programmes have been\\nlaunched and some have been\\nrestructured with the growing experience\\nof administering the programmes. At\\npresent, there are several Poverty\\nAlleviation Programmes (PAPs), mostly in\\nrural areas, which have an explicit food\\ncomponent also. While some of the\\nprogrammes such as PDS, mid-day meals\\netc. are exclusively food security\\nprogrammes, most of the PAPs also\\nenhance food security.

However , these\\nremained consistently higher than the\\nbuffer norms. The situation improved\\nwith the distribution of foodgrains under\\ndifferent schemes launched by the\\ngovernment. There is a general\\nconsensus that high level of buffer\\nstocks of foodgrains is very undesirable\\nand can be wasteful. The storage of\\nmassive food stocks has been\\nresponsible for high carrying costs, in\\naddition to wastage and deterioration in\\ngrain quality. Freezing of MSP for a few\\nyears should be considered seriously.\\nThe increased food grains\\nprocurement at enhanced MSP# is the\\nresult of the pressure exerted by\\nleading foodgrain producing states, such\\nas Punjab, Haryana an d Andhra\\nPradesh. Mor eover , as the pr ocurementis concentrated in a few prosperous\\nregions (Punjab, Haryana, W ester n\\nUttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and to\\na lesser extent in W est Bengal) and\\nmainly of two crops— wheat and rice—\\nincrease in MSP has induced farmers,\\nparticularly in surplus states, to divert\\nland from production of coarse grains,\\nwhich is the staple food of the poor , to\\nthe production of rice and wheat. The\\nintensive utilisation of water in the\\ncultivation of  rice has also led to\\nenvironmental degradation and fall in\\nthe water level, threatening the\\nsustainability of the agricultural\\ndevelopment in thes e states.

In\\nurban India, the per person per month\\nconsumption of rice, too has declined from\\n4.71 Kg in 2004-05 to 4.49 Kg in 2011-12.\\nPer Capita consumption of PDS rice has\\ndoubled in rural India and increased by\\n66% in urban India since 2004-05. The per\\nCapita consumption of PDS wheat has\\ndoubled since 2004-05 in both rural and\\nurban India.\\nPDS dealers are sometimes found\\nresorting to malpractices like diverting\\nthe grains to open market to get better\\nmargin, selling poor quality grains at\\nration shops, irregular opening of the\\nshops, etc. It is common to find that ration\\nshops regularly have unsold stocks of poor\\nquality grains left. This has proved to be\\na big problem. When ration shops are\\nunable to sell, a massive stock of\\nfoodgrains piles up with the FCI. In recent\\nyears, there is another factor that has\\nled to the decline of the PDS. Earlier every\\nfamily, poor and non-poor had a ration\\ncard with a fixed quota of items such as\\nrice, wheat, sugar etc. These were sold\\nat the same low price to every family. The\\nthree types of cards and the range of\\nprices that you see today did not exist. A\\nlarge number of families could buy\\nfoodgrains from the ration shops subject\\nto a fixed quota. These included low\\nincome families whose incomes were\\nmarginally higher than the below poverty\\nline families. Now, with TPDS of three\\ndifferent prices, any family above the\\npoverty line gets very little discount at\\nthe ration shop. The price for APL familyis almost as high as open market price,\\nso there is little incentive for them to buy\\nthese items from the ration shop.\\nRole of cooperatives in food security\\nThe cooperatives are also playing an\\nimportant role in food security in India\\nespecially in the southern and western\\nparts of the country. The cooperative\\nsocieties set  up shops to sell low priced\\ngoods to poor people . For example, out\\nof all fair price shops running in Tamil\\nNadu, around 94 per cent are being run\\nby the cooperatives.

Summary\\nFood security of a nation is ensured if all of its citizens have enough nutritious food\\navailable, all persons have the capacity to buy food of acceptable quality and there\\nis no barrier on access to food. The people living below the poverty line might be food\\ninsecure all the time while better off people might also turn food insecure due to\\ncalamity or disaster . Although a large section of people suf fer from fo od and nutrition\\ninsecurity in India, the worst affected groups are landless or land poor households\\nin rural areas and people employed in ill paid occupations and casual labourers\\nengaged in seasonal activities in the urban areas. The food insecure people are\\ndisproportionately large in some regions of the country, such as economically\\nbackward states with high incidence of poverty, tribal and remote areas, regions\\nmore prone to natural disasters etc. To ensure availability of food to all sections of\\nthe society the Indian government carefully designed food security system, which is\\ncomposed of two components: (a) buffer stock and (b) public distribution system. In\\naddition to PDS, various poverty alleviation programmes were also started which\\ncomprised a component of food security. Some of these programmes are: Integrated\\nChild Development Services (I CDS); F ood-for -Work (FF W); M id-Day M eals; A ntyodaya\\nAnna Y ojana (A AY) etc. I n addition to the role of the government in ensuring fo od\\nsecurity, there are various cooperatives and NGOs also working intensively towards\\nthis direction.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The syllabi and textbooks developed on\\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\\nboundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope these measur es\\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred\\nsystem of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must\\nrecognise that given space, time and freedom, children generate new\\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\\nTreating the pr escribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\\nknowledge.\\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as\\nrigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number\\nof teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for\\nteaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather\\nthan a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to\\naddress the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and\\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for\\nchild psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\\nThe National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining (NCER T)\\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\\nresponsible for this book.

Today we often take the ideas of liberty,\\nfreedom and equality for granted. But we need to remind ourselves that these ideas\\nalso have a history. By looking at the French Revolution you will read a small part\\nof that history. The French Revolution led to the end of monarchy in France. A\\nsociety based on privileges gave way to a new system of governance. The Declaration\\nof the Rights of Man during the revolution, announced the coming of a new time.\\nThe idea that all individuals had rights and could claim equality became part of a\\nnew language of politics. These notions of equality and freedom emerged as the central\\nideas of a new age; but in different countries they were reinterpreted and rethought\\nin many different ways. The anti-colonial movements in India and China, Africa and\\nSouth America, produced ideas that were innovative and original, but they spoke in\\na language that gained currency only from the late eighteenth century.\\nIn Chapter II, you will read about the coming of socialism in Europe, and the dramatic\\nevents that forced the ruling monarch, Tsar Nicholas II, to give up power. The Russian\\nRevolution sought to change society in a different way. It raised the question of\\neconomic equality and the well-being of workers and peasants. The chapter will tell\\nyou about the changes that were initiated by the new Soviet government, the problems\\nit faced and the measures it undertook.

He was 20 years old and married to the Austrian\\nprincess Marie Antoinette. Upon his accession the new king found\\nan empty treasury. Long years of war had drained the financial\\nresources of France. Added to this was the cost of maintaining an\\nextravagant court at the immense palace of Versailles. Under Louis\\nXVI, France helped the thirteen American colonies to gain their\\nindependence from the common enemy, Britain. The war added more\\nthan a billion livres  to a debt that had already risen to more than 2\\nbillion livres. Lenders who gave the state credit, now began to charge\\n10 per cent interest on loans. So the French government was obliged\\nto spend an increasing percentage of its budget on interest payments\\nalone. To meet its regular expenses, such as the cost of maintaining\\nan army, the court, running government offices or universities, the\\nstate was forced to increase taxes.

How do you think he could have gone about doing\\nthis? In France of the Old Regime the monarch did not have the\\npower to impose taxes according to his will alone. Rather he had to\\ncall a meeting of the Estates General which would then pass his\\nproposals for new taxes. The Estates General was a political body to\\nwhich the three estates sent their representatives. However, the\\nmonarch alone could decide when to call a meeting of this body. The\\nlast time it was done was in 1614.\\nOn 5 May 1789, Louis XVI called together an assembly of the Estates\\nGeneral to pass proposals for new taxes. A resplendent hall in\\nVersailles was prepared to host the delegates. The first and second\\nestates sent 300 representatives each, who were seated in rows facing\\neach other on two sides, while the 600 members of the third estate\\nhad to stand at the back. The third estate was represented by its more\\nprosperous and educated members. Peasants, artisans and women\\nwere denied entry to the assembly. However, their grievances and\\ndemands were listed in some 40,000 letters which the representatives\\nhad brought with them.\\nVoting in the Estates General in the past had been conducted according\\nto the principle that each estate had one vote. This time too Louis\\nXVI was determined to continue the same practice. But members of\\nthe third estate demanded that voting now be conducted by the\\nassembly as a  whole, where each member would have one vote. This\\nwas one of the democratic principles put forward by philosophers\\nlike Rousseau in his book The Social Contract . When the king rejected\\nthis proposal, members of the third estate walked out of the assembly\\nin protest.\\nThe representatives of the third estate viewed themselves as spokesmen\\nfor the whole French nation. On 20 June they assembled in the hall\\nof an indoor tennis court in the grounds of Versailles. They declared\\nthemselves a National Assembly and swore not to disperse till they\\nhad drafted a constitution for France that would limit the powers of\\nthe monarch. They were led by Mirabeau and Abbé Sieyès. Mirabeau\\nwas born in a noble family but was convinced of the need to do away\\nwith a society of feudal privilege.

The most successful of these clubs was that of\\nthe Jacobins, which got its name from the former convent  of St\\nJacob in Paris. Women too, who had been active throughout this\\nperiod, formed their own clubs. Section 4 of this chapter will tell\\nyou more about their activities and demands.\\nThe members of the Jacobin club belonged mainly to the less\\nprosperous sections of society. They included small shopkeepers,\\nartisans such as shoemakers, pastry cooks, watch-makers, printers,\\nas well as servants and daily-wage workers. Their leader was\\nMaximilian Robespierre. A large group among the Jacobins decided\\nto start wearing long striped trousers similar to those worn by\\ndock workers. This was to set themselves apart from the fashionable\\nsections of society, especially nobles, who wore knee breeches.

The colonies in\\nthe Caribbean – Martinique, Guadeloupe and San Domingo – were\\nimportant suppliers of commodities such as tobacco, indigo, sugar\\nand coffee. But the reluctance of Europeans to go and work in distant\\nand unfamiliar lands meant a shortage of labour on the plantations.\\nSo this was met by a triangular slave trade between Europe, Africa\\nand the Americas. The slave trade began in the seventeenth century.\\nFrench merchants sailed from the ports of Bordeaux or Nantes to\\nthe African coast, where they bought slaves from local chieftains.\\nBranded and shackled, the slaves were packed tightly into ships for\\nthe three-month long voyage across the Atlantic to the Caribbean.\\nThere they were sold to plantation owners. The exploitation of slave\\nlabour made it possible to meet the growing demand in European\\nmarkets for sugar, coffee, and indigo. Port cities like Bordeaux and\\nNantes owed their economic prosperity to the flourishing slave trade.\\nThroughout the eighteenth century there was little criticism of slavery\\nin France. The National Assembly held long debates about whether\\nthe rights of man should be extended to all French subjects including\\nthose in the colonies. But it did not pass any laws, fearing opposition\\nfrom businessmen whose incomes depended on the slave trade. It\\nwas finally the Convention which in 1794 legislated to free all slaves\\nin the French overseas possessions. This, however, turned out to be\\na short-term measure: ten years later, Napoleon reintroduced slavery.\\nPlantation owners understood their freedom as including the right\\nto enslave African Negroes  in pursuit of their economic interests.\\nSlavery was finally abolished in French colonies in 1848.Fig.14 – The emancipation of slaves.\\nThis print of 1794 describes the emancipation\\nof slaves.

As you\\nhave read, before the eighteenth century society was broadly divided\\ninto estates and orders and it was the aristocracy and church which\\ncontrolled economic and social power. Suddenly, after the revolution,\\nit seemed possible to change this. In many parts of the world including\\nEurope and Asia, new ideas about individual rights and who\\ncontrolled social power began to be discussed. In India, Raja\\nRammohan Roy and Derozio talked of the significance of the French\\nRevolution, and many others debated the ideas of post-revolutionary\\nEurope. The developments in the colonies, in turn, reshaped these\\nideas of societal change.\\nNot everyone in Europe, however, wanted a complete transformation\\nof society. Responses varied from those who accepted that some\\nchange was necessary but wished for a gradual shift, to those who\\nwanted to restructure society radically. Some were ‘conservatives’,\\nothers were ‘liberals’ or ‘radicals’. What did these terms really mean\\nin the context of the time? What separated these strands of politics\\nand what linked them together? We must remember that these terms\\ndo not mean the same thing in all contexts or at all times.\\nWe will look briefly at some of the important political traditions of\\nthe nineteenth century, and see how they influenced change. Then\\nwe will focus on one historical event in which there was an attempt\\nat a radical transformation of society. Through the revolution in\\nRussia, socialism became one of the most significant and powerful\\nideas to shape society in the twentieth century.\\n1.1 Liberals, Radicals and Conservatives\\nOne of the groups which looked to change society were the liberals.\\nLiberals wanted a nation which tolerated all religions.

Liberals\\nalso opposed the uncontrolled power of dynastic rulers. They wanted\\nto safeguard the rights of individuals against governments. They\\nargued for a representative, elected parliamentary government, subject\\nto laws interpreted by a well-trained judiciary that was independent\\nof rulers and officials. However, they were not ‘democrats’. They\\ndid not believe in universal adult franchise, that is, the right of every\\ncitizen to vote. They felt men of property mainly should have the\\nvote. They also did not want the vote for women.\\nIn contrast, radicals wanted a nation in which government was based\\non the majority of a country’s population. Many supported women’s\\nsuffragette  movements. Unlike liberals, they opposed the privileges\\nof great landowners and wealthy factory owners. They were not\\nagainst the existence of private property but disliked concentration\\nof property in the hands of a few.\\nConservatives were opposed to radicals and liberals. After the French\\nRevolution, however, even conservatives had opened their minds to\\nthe need for change. Earlier, in the eighteenth century, conservatives\\nhad been generally opposed to the idea of change. By the nineteenth\\ncentury, they accepted that some change was inevitable but believed\\nthat the past had to be respected and change had to be brought about\\nthrough a slow process.\\nSuch differing ideas about societal change clashed during the social\\nand political turmoil that followed the French Revolution. The\\nvarious attempts at revolution and national transformation in the\\nnineteenth century helped define both the limits and potential of\\nthese political tendencies.\\n1.2 Industrial Society and Social Change\\nThese political trends were signs of a new time. It was a time of\\nprofound social and economic changes. It was a time when new cities\\ncame up and new industrialised regions developed,  railways expanded\\nand the Industrial Revolution occurred.\\nIndustrialisation brought men, women and children to factories.

By the mid - nineteenth century in Europe, socialism\\nwas a well-known body of ideas that attracted widespread attention.\\nSocialists were against private property, and saw it as the root of all social ills\\nof the time. Why? Individuals owned the property that gave employment\\nbut the propertied were concerned only with  personal gain and not with\\nthe welfare of those who made the property productive. So if society as a\\nwhole rather than single individuals controlled property, more attention\\nwould be paid to collective social interests. Socialists wanted this change and\\ncampaigned for it.\\nHow could a society without property operate? What would be the basis of\\nsocialist society?\\nSocialists had different visions of the future. Some believed in the idea of\\ncooperatives.

Marx argued that industrial society was ‘capitalist’.\\nCapitalists owned the capital invested in factories, and the profit of capitalists\\nwas produced by workers.  The conditions of workers could not improve\\nas long as this profit was accumulated by private capitalists. Workers had to\\noverthrow capitalism and the rule of private property. Marx believed that\\nto free themselves from capitalist exploitation, workers had to construct a\\nradically socialist society where all property was socially controlled.

About 85 per cent of the Russian\\nempire’s population earned their living from agriculture. This\\nproportion was higher than in most European countries. For instance,\\nin France and Germany the proportion was between 40 per cent and\\n50 per cent. In the empire, cultivators produced for the market as\\nwell as for their own needs and Russia was a major exporter of grain.\\nIndustry was found in pockets. Prominent industrial areas were\\nSt Petersburg and Moscow. Craftsmen undertook much of the\\nproduction, but large factories existed alongside craft workshops.\\nMany factories were set up in the 1890s, when Russia’s railway\\nnetwork was extended, and foreign investment in industry increased.\\nCoal production doubled and iron and steel output quadrupled. By\\nthe 1900s, in some areas factory workers and craftsmen were almost\\nequal in number.\\nMost industry was the private property of industrialists. Government\\nsupervised large factories to ensure minimum wages and limited hours\\nof work. But factory inspectors could not prevent rules being broken.\\nIn craft units and small workshops, the working day was sometimes\\n15 hours, compared with 10 or 12 hours in factories. Accommodation\\nvaried from rooms to dormitories.\\nWorkers were a divided social group. Some had strong links with\\nthe villages from which they came. Others had settled in cities\\npermanently. Workers were divided by skill. A metalworker of St.\\nPetersburg recalled, ‘Metalworkers considered themselves aristocrats\\namong other workers. Their occupations demanded more training\\nand skill . . . ’ Women made up 31 per cent of the factory labour\\nforce by 1914, but they were paid less than men (between half and\\nthree-quarters of a man’s wage). Divisions among workers showed\\nthemselves in dress and manners too. Some workers formed\\nassociations to help members in times of unemployment or financial\\nhardship b ut suc h associa tions w ere few.\\nDespite divisions, workers did unite to strike work (stop work) when\\nthey disagreed with employers about dismissals or work conditions.\\nThese strikes took place  frequently in the textile industry during\\n1896-1897, and in the metal industry during 1902.\\nIn the countryside, peasants cultivated most of the land.

But except in a few cases they had no respect for the\\nnobility. Nobles got their power and position through their services\\nto the Tsar, not through local popularity. This was unlike France\\nwhere, during the French Revolution in Brittany, peasants respected\\nnobles and fought for them. In Russia, peasants wanted the land of\\nthe nobles to be given to them. Frequently, they refused to pay rent\\nand even murdered landlords. In 1902, this occurred on a large scale\\nin south Russia. And in 1905,  such incidents took place all\\nover Russia.\\nRussian peasants were different from other European peasants in\\nanother way. They pooled their land together periodically and their\\ncommune ( mir) divided it according to the needs of individual families.\\n2.3 Socialism in Russia\\nAll political parties were illegal in Russia before 1914. The Russian\\nSocial Democratic Workers Party was founded in 1898 by socialists\\nwho respected Marx’s ideas. However, because of government\\npolicing, it had to operate as an illegal organisation. It set up a\\nnewspaper, mobilised workers and organised strikes.\\nSome Russian socialists felt that the Russian peasant custom of dividing\\nland periodically made them natural socialists. So peasants, not\\nworkers, would be the main force of the revolution, and Russia could\\nbecome socialist more quickly than other countries. Socialists were\\nactive in the countryside through the late nineteenth century.  They\\nformed the Socialist Revolutionary Party in 1900. This party struggled\\nfor peasants’ rights and demanded that land belonging to nobles be\\ntransferred to peasants. Social Democrats disagreed with Socialist\\nRevolutionaries about peasants. Lenin felt that peasants were not\\none united group. Some were poor and others rich, some worked as\\nlabourers while others were capitalists who employed workers. Given\\nthis ‘differentiation’ within them, they could not all be part of a\\nsocialist movement.\\nThe party was divided over the strategy of organisation. Vladimir\\nLenin (who led the Bolshevik group) thought that in a repressive\\nsociety like Tsarist Russia the party should be disciplined and should\\ncontrol the number and quality of its members.  Others (Mensheviks)\\nthought that the party should be open to all (as in Germany).\\n2.4 A Turbulent Time: The 1905 Revolution\\nRussia was an autocracy .

Over\\n100 workers were killed and about 300 wounded. The incident,\\nknown as Bloody Sunday, started a series of events that became known\\nas the 1905 Revolution. Strikes took place all over the country and\\nuniversities closed down when student bodies staged walkouts,\\ncomplaining about the lack of civil liberties. Lawyers, doctors,\\nengineers and other middle-class workers established the Union of\\nUnions and demanded a constituent assembly.\\nDuring the 1905 Revolution, the Tsar allowed the creation of an\\nelected consultative Parliament or Duma.

Anti-\\nGerman sentiments ran high,  as can be seen in the\\nrenaming of St Petersburg – a German name – as\\nPetrograd. The Tsarina Alexandra’s German\\norigins and poor advisers, especially a monk called\\nRasputin, made the autocracy unpopular.\\nThe First World War on the ‘eastern front’ differed\\nfrom that on the ‘western front’. In the west, armies\\nfought from trenches stretched along eastern\\nFrance. In the east, armies moved a good deal and\\nfought battles leaving large casualties.

The destruction of\\ncrops and buildings led to over 3 million refugees in Russia. The\\nsituation discredited the government and the Tsar.  Soldiers did not\\nwish to fight such a war.\\nThe war also had a severe impact on industry. Russia’s own industries\\nwere few in number and  the country was cut off from other suppliers\\nof industrial goods by German control of the Baltic Sea. Industrial\\nequipment disintegrated more rapidly in Russia than elsewhere in\\nEurope. By 1916, railway lines began to break down. Able-bodied\\nmen were called up to the war. As a result, there were labour shortages\\nand small workshops producing essentials were shut down. Large\\nsupplies of grain were sent to feed the army.

By 1927-\\n1928, the towns in Soviet Russia were facing an acute\\nproblem of grain supplies. The government fixed prices\\nat which grain must be sold, but the  peasants refused to sell their\\ngrain to government buyers at these prices.\\nStalin, who headed the party after the death of Lenin, introduced\\nfirm emergency measures. He believed that rich peasants and traders\\nin the countryside were holding stocks in the hope of higher prices.\\nSpeculation had to be stopped and supplies confiscated.\\nIn 1928, Party members toured the grain-producing areas, supervising\\nenforced grain collections, and raiding ‘kulaks’ –  the name for well-\\nto-do peasants. As shortages continued, the decision was taken to\\ncollectivise farms. It was argued that grain shortages were partly due\\nto the small size of holdings. After 1917, land had been  given over to\\npeasants. These small-sized peasant farms could not be modernised.\\nTo develop modern farms, and run them along industrial lines with\\nmachinery, it was necessary to ‘eliminate kulaks’, take away land\\nfrom peasants, and establish state-controlled large farms.\\nWhat followed was Stalin’s collectivisation programme. From 1929,\\nthe Party forced all peasants to cultivate in collective farms ( kolkhoz ).\\nThe bulk of land and implements were transferred to the ownership\\nof collective farms. Peasants worked on the land, and the kolkhoz\\nprofit was shared. Enraged peasants resisted the authorities and\\ndestroyed their livestock. Between 1929 and 1931, the number of\\ncattle fell by one-third. Those who resisted collectivisation were\\nseverely punished. Many were deported  and exiled . As they resisted\\ncollectivisation, peasants argued that they were not rich and they\\nwere not against socialism. They merely did not want to work in\\ncollective farms for a variety of reasons. Stalin’s government allowed\\nsome independent cultivation, but treated such cultivators\\nunsympathetically.\\nIn spite of collectivisation, production did not increase immediately.\\nIn fact, the bad harvests of 1930-1933 led to one of most devastating\\nfamines in Soviet history when over 4 million died.\\nFig.18 – A poster during collectivisation.

According\\nto this there was no equality between people, but only a racial\\nhierarchy. In this view blond, blue-eyed, Nordic German Aryans\\nwere at the top, while Jews were located at the lowest rung. They\\ncame to be regarded as an anti-race, the arch-enemies of the Aryans.\\nAll other coloured people were placed in between depending upon\\ntheir external features. Hitler’s racism borrowed from thinkers like\\nCharles Darwin and Herbert Spencer. Darwin was a natural scientist\\nwho tried to explain the creation of plants and animals through the\\nconcept of evolution and natural selection. Herbert Spencer later\\nadded the idea of survival of the fittest. According to this idea, only\\nthose species survived on earth that could adapt themselves to\\nchanging climatic conditions. We should bear in mind that Darwin\\nnever advocated human intervention in what he thought was a purely\\nnatural process of selection. However, his ideas were used by racist\\nthinkers and politicians to justify imperial rule over conquered\\npeoples. The Nazi argument was simple: the strongest race would\\nsurvive and the weak ones would perish. The Aryan race was the\\nfinest. It had to retain its purity, become stronger and dominate the\\nworld.\\nThe other aspect of Hitler’s ideology related to the geopolitical\\nconcept of Lebensraum , or living space. He believed that new territories\\nhad to be acquired for settlement. This would enhance the area of\\nthe mother country, while enabling the settlers on new lands to retain\\nan intimate link with the place of their origin. It would also enhance\\nthe material resources and power of the German nation.\\nHitler intended to extend German boundaries by moving eastwards,\\nto concentrate all Germans geographically in one place.

The demand for these crops increased in nineteenth-century\\nEurope where foodgrains were needed to feed the growing urban\\npopulation and raw materials were required for industrial\\nproduction. Second,  in the early nineteenth century, the colonial\\nstate thought that forests were unproductive. They were considered\\nto be wilderness that had to be brought under cultivation so that\\nthe land could yield agricultural products and revenue, and enhance\\nthe income of the state. So between 1880 and 1920, cultivated area\\nrose by 6.7 million hectares.\\nWe always see the expansion of cultivation as a sign of progress.\\nBut we should not forget that for land to be brought under the\\nplough, forests have to be cleared.\\n1.2 Sleepers on the TracksBox 1\\nThe absence of cultivation in a place does not mean the land was\\nuninhabited.

The system they\\ntaught here was called ‘scientific forestry’ . Many people now,\\nincluding ecologists, feel that this system is not scientific at all.\\nIn scientific forestry, natural forests which had lots of different types\\nof trees were cut down. In their place, one type of tree was planted\\nin straight rows. This is called a plantation. Forest officials surveyed\\nthe forests, estimated the area under different types of trees, and\\nmade working plans for forest management. They planned how much\\nof the  plantation area to cut every year. The area  cut was then to be\\nreplanted so that it was ready to be cut again in some years.\\nAfter the Forest Act was enacted in 1865, it was amended twice,\\nonce in 1878 and then in 1927. The 1878 Act divided forests into\\nthree categories: reserved, protected and village forests. The best\\nforests were called ‘reserved forests’. Villagers could not take anything\\nfrom these forests, even for their own use. For house building or\\nfuel, they could take wood from protected or village forests.\\n2.1 How were the Lives of P eople Affected?\\nForesters and villagers had very different ideas of what a good forest\\nshould look like.

In\\naddition to the Earth, they show respect to the spirits of the river,\\nthe forest and the mountain. Since each village knows where its\\nboundaries lie, the local people look after all the natural resources\\nwithin that boundary.  If people from a village want to take some\\nwood from the forests of another village, they pay a small fee called\\ndevsari , dand or man in exchange. Some villages also protect their forests\\nby engaging watchmen and each household contributes some grain\\nto pay them.  Every year there is one big hunt where the headmen of\\nvillages in a pargana (cluster of  villa ges) meet and discuss issues of\\nconcern, including forests.\\n3.2 The Fears of the P eople\\nWhen the colonial government proposed to reserve two-thirds of\\nthe forest in 1905, and stop shifting cultivation, hunting and collection\\nof forest produce, the people of Bastar were very worried. Some\\nvillages were allowed to stay on in the reserved forests on the condition\\nthat they worked free for the forest department in cutting and\\ntransporting trees, and protecting the forest from fires. Subsequently,\\nthese came to be known as ‘forest villages’. People of other villages\\nwere displaced without any notice or compensation. For long,\\nvillagers had been suffering from increased land rents and frequent\\ndemands for free labour and goods by colonial officials. Then came\\nthe terrible famines, in 1899-1900 and again in 1907-1908.  Reservations\\nproved to be the last straw.\\nPeople began to gather and discuss these issues in their village councils,\\nin bazaars and at festivals or wherever the headmen and priests of\\nseveral villages were assembled. The initiative was taken by the\\nDhurwas of the Kanger forest, where reservation first took place.\\nAlthough there was no single leader, many people speak of  Gunda\\nDhur, from  village Nethanar, as an important figure in the\\nmovement. In 1910, mango boughs, a lump of earth, chillies and\\narrows, began circulating between villages. These were actually\\nmessages inviting villagers to rebel against the British. Every village\\ncontributed something to the rebellion expenses. Bazaars were looted,\\nthe houses of officials and traders, schools and police stations were\\nburnt and robbed, and grain redistributed. Most of those who were\\nattacked were in some way associated with the colonial state and its\\noppressive laws.

But\\nonce upon a time it was covered mostly with forests. The colonial\\npower in Indonesia were the Dutch, and as we will see, there were\\nmany similarities in the laws for forest control in Indonesia and\\nIndia.  Java in Indonesia is where the Dutch started forest\\nmanagement. Like the British, they wanted timber from Java to\\nbuild ships. In 1600, the population of Java was an estimated 3.4\\nmillion. There were many villages in the fertile plains, but there\\nwere also many communities living in the mountains and practising\\nshifting cultivation.\\n4.1 The Woodcutters of Java\\nThe Kalangs of Java were a community of skilled forest cutters and\\nshifting cultivators. They were so valuable that in 1755 when the\\nMataram kingdom of Java split, the 6,000 Kalang families were\\nequally divided between the two kingdoms. Without their expertise,\\nit would have been difficult to harvest teak and for the kings to\\nbuild their palaces. When the Dutch began to gain control over the\\nforests in the eighteenth century, they tried to make the Kalangs\\nwork under them. In 1770, the Kalangs resisted by attacking a Dutch\\nfort at Joana, but the uprising was suppressed.\\n4.2 Dutch Scientific Forestry\\nIn the nineteenth century, when it became\\nimportant to control territory and not just\\npeople, the Dutch enacted forest laws in Java,\\nrestricting villagers’ access to forests. Now\\nwood could only be cut for specified purposes\\nlike making river boats or constructing houses,\\nand only from specific forests under close\\nsupervision. Villagers were punished for\\ngrazing cattle in young stands, transporting\\nwood without a permit, or travelling on forest\\nroads with horse carts or cattle.\\nAs in India, the need to manage forests for\\nshipbuilding and railways led to the4  Forest Transformations in Java\\nFig.21 – Train transporting teak out of the forest – late colonial period.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

In 1882, 280,000 sleepers were\\nexported from Java alone. However, all this required labour to cut\\nthe trees, transport the logs and prepare the sleepers. The Dutch\\nfirst imposed rents on land being cultivated in the forest and then\\nexempted some villages from these rents if they worked collectively\\nto provide free labour and buffaloes for cutting and transporting\\ntimber.  This was known as the blandongdiensten system. Later, instead\\nof rent exemption, forest villagers were given small wages, but their\\nright to cultivate forest land was restricted.\\n4.3 Samin’s Challenge\\nAround 1890, Surontiko Samin of Randublatung village, a teak forest\\nvillage, began questioning state ownership of the forest. He argued that\\nthe state had not created the wind, water, earth and wood, so it could not\\nown it. Soon a widespread movement developed.

In India, working plans were abandoned at this time, and\\nthe forest department cut trees freely to meet British war needs. In\\nJava, just before the Japanese occupied the region, the Dutch followed\\n‘a scorched earth’ policy, destroying sawmills, and burning huge\\npiles of giant teak logs so that they would not fall into Japanese\\nhands. The Japanese then exploited the forests recklessly for their\\nown war industries, forcing forest villagers to cut down forests.\\nMany villagers used this opportunity to expand cultivation in the\\nforest. After the war, it was difficult for the Indonesian forest service\\nto get this land back. As in India, people’s need for agricultural land\\nhas brought them into conflict with the forest department’s desire\\nto control the land and exclude people from it.\\n4.5 New Developments in Forestry\\nSince the 1980s, governments across Asia and Africa have begun to\\nsee that scientific forestry and the policy of keeping forest\\ncommunities  away from forests has resulted in many conflicts.\\nConservation of forests rather than collecting timber has become a\\nmore important goal. The government has recognised that in order\\nto meet this goal, the people who live near the forests must be\\ninvolved. In many cases, across India, from Mizoram to Kerala, dense\\nforests have survived only because villages protected them in sacred\\ngroves kno wn as sarnas, devarakudu, kan, rai,  etc. Some villag es ha ve\\nbeen patrolling their own forests, with each household taking it in\\nturns, instead of leaving it to the forest guards.

Their agricultural stock\\ndeclined and their trades and crafts were adversely affected. How?\\nFirst, the colonial state wanted to transform all grazing lands\\ninto cultivated farms. Land revenue was one of the main sources\\nof its finance. By expanding cultivation it could increase its revenue\\ncollection. It could at the same time produce more jute, cotton,\\nwheat and other agricultural produce that were required in\\nEngland. To colonial officials all uncultivated land appeared to\\nbe unproductive: it produced neither revenue nor agricultural\\nproduce. It was seen as ‘waste land’ that needed to be brought\\nunder cultivation. From the mid-nineteenth century, Waste Land\\nRules were enacted in various parts of the country. By these Rules\\nuncultivated lands were taken over and given to select individuals.\\nThese individuals were granted various concessions and encouraged\\nto settle these lands. Some of them were made headmen of villages\\nin the newly cleared areas. In most areas the lands taken over\\nwere actually grazing tracts used regularly by pastoralists. So\\nexpansion of cultivation inevitably meant the decline of pastures\\nand a problem for pastoralists.\\nSecond, by the mid-nineteenth century, various Forest Acts were\\nalso being enacted in the different provinces.  Through these Acts\\nsome forests which produced commercially valuable timber like\\ndeodar or sal were declared ‘Reserved’. No pastoralist was allowed\\naccess to these forests. Other forests were classified as ‘Protected’.\\nIn these, some customary  grazing rights of pastoralists were\\ngranted but their movements were severely restricted. The\\ncolonial officials believed that grazing destroyed the saplings and\\nyoung shoots of trees that germinated on the forest floor. The\\nherds trampled over the saplings and munched away the shoots.\\nThis prevented new trees from growing.\\nThese Forest Acts changed the lives of pastoralists. They were\\nnow prevented from entering many forests that had earlier\\nprovided valuable forage for their cattle. Even in the areas they\\nwere allowed entry, their movements were regulated. They needed\\na permit for entry.

Pastoralists could no longer remain in an area even if\\nforage was available, the grass was succulent and the undergrowth\\nin the forest was ample. They had to move because the Forest\\nDepartment permits that had been issued to them now ruled their\\nlives. The permit specified the period s in which  they could be\\nlegally within a forest. If they overstayed they were liable to fines.\\nThird, British officials were suspicious of nomadic people. They\\ndistrusted mobile craftsmen and traders who hawked their goods\\nin villages, and pastoralists who changed their places of residence\\nevery season, moving in search of good pastures for their herds.\\nThe colonial government wanted to rule over a settled population.\\nThey wanted the rural people to live in villages, in fixed places\\nwith fixed rights on particular fields. Such a population was easy\\nto identify and control. Those who were settled were seen as\\npeaceable and law abiding; those who were nomadic were\\nconsidered to be criminal. In 1871, the colonial government in\\nIndia passed the Criminal Tribes Act.  By this Act many\\ncommunities of craftsmen, traders and pastoralists were classified\\nas Criminal Tribes. They were stated to be criminal by nature\\nand birth. Once this Act came into force, these communities were\\nexpected to live only in notified village settlements. They were\\nnot allowed to move out without a permit. The village police\\nkept a continuous watch on them.\\nFourth , to expand its revenue income, the colonial government\\nlooked for every possible source of taxation. So tax was imposed\\non land, on canal water, on salt, on trade goods, and even on\\nanimals. Pastoralists had to pay tax on every animal they grazed\\non the pastures. In most pastoral tracts of India, grazing tax was\\nintroduced in the mid-nineteenth century. The tax per head of\\ncattle went up rapidly and the system of collection was made\\nincreasingly efficient. In the decades between the 1850s and 1880s\\nthe right to collect the tax was auctioned out to contractors. These\\ncontractors tried to extract as high a tax as they could to recover\\nthe money they had paid to the state and earn as much profit as\\nthey could within the year. By the 1880s the government began\\ncollecting taxes directly from the pastoralists. Each of them was\\ngiven a pass. To enter a grazing tract, a cattle herder had to show\\nthe pass and pay the tax. The number of cattle heads he had and\\nthe amount of tax he paid was entered on the pass.In the 1920s, a Royal Commission on\\nAgriculture reported:\\n‘The extent of the area available for\\ngrazing has gone down tremendously\\nwith the extension of area under\\ncultivation because of increasing\\npopulation, extension of irrigation\\nfacilities, acquiring the pastures for\\nGovernment purposes, for example,\\ndefence, industries and agricultural\\nexperimental farms.

When grazing\\nlands were taken over and turned into cultivated fields, the available\\narea of pastureland declined. Similarly, the reservation of forests\\nmeant that shepherds and cattle herders could no longer freely pasture\\ntheir cattle in the forests.\\nAs pasturelands disappeared under the plough, the existing animal\\nstock had to feed on whatever grazing land remained. This led to\\ncontinuous intensive grazing of these pastures. Usually nomadic\\npastoralists grazed their animals in one area and moved to another\\narea. These pastoral movements allowed time for the natural\\nrestoration of vegetation growth. When restrictions were imposed\\non pastoral movements, grazing lands came to be continuously used\\nand the quality of patures declined.  This in turn created a further\\nshortage of forage for animals and the deterioration of animal stock.\\nUnderfed cattle died in large numbers during scarcities and famines.\\nFig.11 – Pastoralists in India.\\nThis map indicates the location of only those\\npastoral communities mentioned in the\\nchapter.

Some\\nreduced the number of cattle in their herds, since there was not\\nenough pasture to feed large numbers. Others  discovered new\\npastures when movement to old grazing grounds became difficult.\\nAfter 1947, the camel and sheep herding Raikas, for instance, could\\nno longer move into Sindh and graze their camels on the banks of\\nthe Indus, as they had done earlier. The new political boundaries\\nbetween India and Pakistan stopped their movement. So they had\\nto find new places to go. In recent years they have been migrating\\nto Haryana where sheep can graze on agricultural fields after the\\nharvests are cut. This is the time that the fields need manure that\\nthe animals provide.\\nOver the years, some richer pastoralists began buying land and\\nsettling down, giving up their nomadic life. Some became settled\\npeasants cultivating land, others took to more extensive trading.\\nMany poor pastoralists, on the other hand, borrowed money from\\nmoneylenders to survive. At times they lost their cattle and sheep\\nand became labourers, working on fields or in small towns.\\nYet, pastoralists not only continue to survive, in many regions\\ntheir numbers have expanded over recent decades. When\\npasturelands in one place was closed to them, they changed the\\ndirection of their movement, reduced the size of the herd, combined\\npastoral activity with other forms of income and adapted to the\\nchanges in the modern world. Many ecologists believe that in dry\\nregions and in the mountains, pastoralism is still ecologically the\\nmost viable form of life.\\nSuch changes were not  experienced only  by pastoral communities\\nin India.

The British\\nimposed various restrictions on raiding and warfare.\\nConsequently, the traditional authority of both elders and\\nwarriors was adversely affected.\\nThe chiefs appointed by the colonial government often\\naccumulated wealth over time. They had a regular income with\\nwhich they could buy animals, goods and land. They lent\\nmoney to poor neighbours who needed cash to pay taxes. Many\\nof them began living in towns, and became involved in trade.\\nTheir wives and children stayed back in the villages to look\\nafter the animals. These chiefs managed to survive the\\ndevastations of war and drought. They had both pastoral and\\nnon-pastoral income, and could buy animals when their stock\\nwas depleted.\\nBut the life history of the poor pastoralists who depended only\\non their livestock was different. Most often, they did not have\\nthe resources to tide over bad times. In times of war and famine,\\nthey lost nearly everything. They had to go looking for work\\nin the towns. Some eked out a living as charcoal burners, others\\ndid odd jobs. The lucky could get more regular work in road\\nor building construction.\\nThe social changes in Maasai society occurred at two levels.\\nFirst, the traditional difference based on age, between the elders\\nFig.17  - Even today, young men go through\\nan elaborate ritual before they become\\nwarriors, although actually it is no longer\\ncommon.

Second, a new distinction between the wealthy and poor\\npastoralists developed.\\nConclusion\\nSo we see that pastoral communities in different parts of the world\\nare affected  in a variety of different ways by changes in the modern\\nworld. New laws and new borders affect the patterns of their\\nmovement. With increasing restrictions on their mobility,\\npastoralists find it difficult to move in search of pastures. As pasture\\nlands disappear grazing becomes a problem, while pastures that\\nremain deteriorate through continuous over grazing. Times of\\ndrought become times of crises, when cattle die in large numbers.\\nYet, pastoralists do adapt to new times. They change the paths of\\ntheir annual movement, reduce their cattle numbers, press for rights\\nto enter new areas, exert political pressure on the government for\\nrelief, subsidy and other forms of support and demand a right in\\nthe management of forests and water resources. Pastoralists are not\\nrelics of the past. They are not people who have no place in the\\nmodern world. Environmentalists and economists have increasingly\\ncome to recognise that pastoral nomadism is a form of life that is\\nperfectly suited to many hilly and dry regions of the world.\\nFig.18 – A Raika shepherd on Jaipur highway.\\nHeavy traffic on highways has made migration of shepherds a new experience.\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'class9\\\\combined_4.pdf', 'page': 120}, page_content='Foreword\\nThe National Curriculum Framework, 2005, recommends that children’s\\nlife at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle\\nmarks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to\\nshape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community.\\nThe syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt\\nto implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning\\nand the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas.\\nWe hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of\\na child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on\\nEducation (1986).\\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and\\nto pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognize that, given\\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\\nthe information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook\\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\\nand sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible\\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers\\nof a fixed body of knowledge.\\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching\\ndays are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular\\nburden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavor by giving higher priority\\nand space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in\\nsmall groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\\nNCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development\\ncommittee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of\\nthe Advisory Group on Social Science, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the\\nChief Advisor for this book, Professor Neeladri Bhattacharya for guiding\\nthe  work of this committee.

History\\nis about tracking these changes, understanding how and why they are taking place,\\nhow the present world in which we live has evolved.\\nThe focus of the history books of Classes IX and X is on the emergence of the contemporary\\nworld. In earlier classes (VI – VIII) you have read about the history of India. In the next\\ntwo years (Classes IX and X) y ou will see ho w the stor y of India’ s pasts is r elated to the\\nlarger histor y of the w orld. We cannot under stand w hat was happening within India unless\\nwe see this connection.

Our focus will shift according\\nto themes.\\nWhat are these themes and how are they organised? What is the logic behind the\\nchoices of themes?\\nAll too often in the past, the history of the modern world was associated with the\\nhistory of the west. It was as if change and progress happened only in the west. As if\\nthe histories of other countries were frozen in time, they were motionless and static.\\nPeople in the west were seen as enterprising, innovative, scientific, industrious, efficient\\nand willing to change. People in the east - or in Africa and South America - were\\nconsidered traditional, lazy, superstitious, and resistant to change.\\nFor many years now these notions have been questioned by historians.

We have to see ho w the histories of  these dif ferent countries\\nwere inter-linked. Changes in one society shaped the other; developments in India and\\nother colonies impacted on Europe. The contemporary world was not shaped by the\\nwest alone.\\nSo the history of the contemporary world is not only about the growth of\\nindustries and trade, technology and science, railways and roads. It is equally\\nabout the forest dwellers and pastoralists, shifting cultivators and small peasants.\\nAll these social groups in diverse ways have played their part in making the\\ncontemporary world what it is. And it is this varied world which you will learn\\nabout this year.\\nSection I , in both books, \\nfocuses on some of the events and processes that are\\ncritical to the understanding of the modern world. This year you will read\\nabout the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution and Nazism in this\\nsection. Next year you will know about nationalism and anti-colonial movements\\nin India  and elsewhere.\\nSection II will move from dramatic events to the routines of people’s lives – their\\neconomic activities and livelihood patterns. You will see what the contemporary\\nworld has meant for forest people  and pastoralists; and how they have coped\\nwith and defined the nature of these changes. Next year you will read more\\nabout the processes of industrialisation and urbanisation, capitalism\\nand colonialism.\\nTrue, we read a lot about such issues. But what we read does not tell us about\\ntheir histories. They give us no idea of how things have evolved and why they\\nchange. Once we learn to ask historical questions about all that is around us,\\nhistory in fact acquires a new meaning. It allows us to see everyday things from\\na different angle. We realise that even seemingly ordinary things have a history\\nthat is important for us to know.\\nTo know how the contemporary world has evolved we will therefore move\\nfrom India to Africa, from Europe to Indonesia. We will read both about the\\nbig events and important ideas, as well as everyday life.

I read somewhere\\nthat the word democracy comes from a Greek\\nword ‘Demokratia’. In Greek ‘demos’ means\\npeople and ‘kratia’ means rule. So democracy is\\nrule by the people. This is the correct meaning.\\nWhere is the need to debate?\\nLyngdoh Madam : That is also a very helpful way\\nof thinking about this matter . I would just say\\nthat this does not always work. A word does not\\nremain tied to its origin. Just think of computers.\\nOriginally they were used for computing, that is to\\nsay calculating, very difficult mathematical sums.\\nThese were ver y power ful calculators. But nowa-\\ndays very few people use computers for comput-\\ning sums. They use it for writing, for designing, for\\nlistening to music and for watching films.

First we spend\\ntime discussing democracy and then we want\\nto find out the meaning of democracy . I mean\\nlogically shouldn’t we have approached it the\\nother way round? Shouldn’t the meaning have\\ncome first and then the example?\\nLyngdoh Madam: I can see your point. But that is\\nnot how we reason in everyday life. We use\\nwords like pen, rain or love. Do we wait to have\\na definition of these words before we use them?\\nCome to think of it, do we have clear definition\\nof these words? It is only by using a word that\\nwe understand its meaning.\\nMerry : But then why do we need definitions at all?\\nLyngdoh Madam : We need a definition only when\\nwe come across a difficulty in the use of a word.\\nWe need a definition of rain only when we wish to\\ndistinguish it from, say , drizzle or cloudburst.

One simple factor\\ncommon to all democracies is: the\\ngovernment is chosen by the people.\\nWe could thus start with a simple\\ndefinition: democracy is a form of\\ngovernment in which the rulers are\\nelected by the people.\\nThis is a useful starting point. This\\ndefinition allows us to separate\\ndemocracy from forms of government\\nthat are clearly not democratic. The\\narmy rulers of Myanmar were not\\nelected by the people. Those who\\nhappened to be in control of the army\\nbecame the rulers of the country.\\nPeople had no say in this decision.\\nDictators like Pinochet (Chile) are not\\nelected by the people.

It reminds us that\\ndemocracy is people’s rule. But if we\\nuse this definition in an unthinking\\nmanner, we would end up calling\\nalmost every government that holds\\nan election a democracy. That would\\nbe very misleading. As we shall find\\nout in Chapter 3, every government\\nin contemporary world wants to be\\ncalled a democracy, even if it is not\\nso. That is why we need to carefully\\ndistinguish between a government\\nthat is a democracy and one that\\npretends to be one.

The existence of\\ndemocracy in India made the\\nIndian government respond to food\\nscarcity in a way that the Chinese\\ngovernment did not. They point out\\nthat no large-scale famine has ever\\ntaken place in an independent and\\ndemocratic country. If China too had\\nmultiparty elections, an opposition\\nparty and a press free to criticise the\\ngovernment, then so many people\\nmay not have died in the famine.\\nThis example brings out one of the\\nreasons why democracy is considered\\nthe best form of government.\\nDemocracy is better than any other\\nform of government in responding to\\nthe needs of the people. A non-\\ndemocratic government may and can\\nrespond to the people’s needs, but it\\nall depends on the wishes of the\\npeople who rule. If the rulers don’t\\nwant to, they don’t have to act\\naccording to the wishes of the people.\\nA democracy requires that the rulers\\nhave to attend to the needs of the\\npeople. A democratic government is\\na better government because it is a\\nmore accountable form of\\ngovernment .\\nThere is another reason why\\ndemocracy should lead to better\\ndecisions than any non-democratic\\ngovernment. Democracy is based on\\nconsultation and discussion. A\\ndemocratic decision always involves\\nmany persons, discussions and\\nmeetings. When a number of people\\nput their heads together, they are\\nable to point out possible mistakes\\nin any decision. This takes time. But\\nthere is a big advantage in taking\\ntime over important decisions. This\\nreduces the chances of rash or\\nirresponsible decisions. Thus\\ndemocracy improves the quality\\nof decision-making.This is related to the third\\nargument. Democracy provides a\\nmethod to deal with differences\\nand conflicts. In any society people\\nare bound to have differences of\\nopinions and interests. These\\ndifferences are particularly sharp in\\na country like ours which has an\\namazing social diversity. People\\nbelong to different regions, speak\\ndifferent languages, practise\\ndifferent religions and have different\\ncastes. They look at the world very\\ndifferently and have different\\npreferences. The preferences of one\\ngroup can clash with those of other\\ngroups. How do we resolve such a\\nconflict? The conflict can be solved\\nby brutal power. Whichever group\\nis more powerful will dictate its\\nterms and others will have to accept\\nthat. But that would lead to\\nresentment and unhappiness.\\nDifferent groups may not be able to\\nlive together for long in such a way.\\nDemocracy provides the only\\npeaceful solution to this problem. In\\ndemocracy, no one is a permanent\\nwinner. No one is a permanent loser.\\nDifferent groups can live with one\\nanother peacefully. In a diverse\\ncountry like India, democracy keeps\\nour country together.\\nThese three arguments were about\\nthe effects of democracy on the\\nquality of government and social life.\\nBut the strongest argument for\\ndemocracy is not about what\\ndemocracy does to the government.\\nIt is about what democracy does to\\nthe citizens. Even if democracy does\\nnot bring about better decisions and\\naccountable government, it is still\\nbetter than other forms of\\ngovernment. Democracy enhances\\nthe dignity of citizens .

As we saw above, there is\\nno guarantee that mistakes cannot\\nbe made in democracy. No form of\\ngovernment can guarantee that. The\\nadvantage in a democracy is that\\nsuch mistakes cannot be hidden for\\nlong. There is a space for public\\ndiscussion on these mistakes. And\\nthere is a room for correction.

For\\nthis we need to turn to broader\\nmeanings of democracy.\\nSometimes we use democracy for\\norganisations other than the\\ngovernment. Just read these\\nstatements:\\n/UIstop“We are a very democratic family.\\nWhenever a decision has to be taken,\\nwe all sit down and arrive at a\\nconsensus. My opinion matters as much\\nas my father’s .”\\n/UIstop“I don’t like teachers who do not allow\\nstudents to speak and ask questions in\\nthe class. I would like to have teachers\\nwith democratic temperament. ”\\n/UIstop“One leader and his family members\\ndecide everything in this party. How can\\nthey talk of democracy? ”\\nThese ways of using the word\\ndemocracy go back to its basic\\nsense of a method of taking\\ndecisions. A democratic decision\\ninvolves consultation with and\\nconsent of all those who are affected\\nby that decision. Those who are not\\npowerful have the same say in\\ntaking the decision as those who are\\npowerful. This can apply to a\\ngovernment or a family or any other\\norganisation. Thus democracy is\\nalso a principle that can be applied\\nto any sphere of life.\\nSometimes we use the word\\ndemocracy not to describe any\\nexisting government but to set up\\nan ideal standard that all\\ndemocracies must aim to become:\\n/UIstop“True democracy will come to this\\ncountry only when no one goes hungry\\nto bed. ”\\n/UIstop“In a democracy every citizen must be\\nable to play equal role in decision\\nmaking. For this you don’t need just an\\nequal right to vote. Every citizen needs\\nto have equal information, basic\\neducation, equal resources and a lot of\\ncommitment. ”If we take these ideals seriously,\\nthen no country in the world is a\\ndemocracy. Yet an understanding of\\ndemocracy as an ideal reminds us\\nof why we value democracy. It\\nenables us to judge an existing\\ndemocracy and identify its\\nweaknesses. It helps us to\\ndistinguish between a minimal\\ndemocracy and a good democracy.\\nIn this book we do not deal much\\nwith this expanded notion of\\ndemocracy. Our focus here is with\\nsome core institutional features of\\ndemocracy as a form of government.\\nNext year you will read more about\\na democratic society and ways of\\nevaluating our democracy. At this\\nstage we just need to note that\\ndemocracy can apply to many\\nspheres of life and that democracy\\ncan take many forms. There can be\\nvarious ways of taking decisions in\\na democratic manner, as long as the\\nbasic principle of consultation on an\\nequal basis is accepted. The most\\ncommon form of democracy in\\ntoday’s world is rule through\\npeople’s elected representatives. We\\nshall read more about that in\\nChapter 3. But if the community is\\nsmall, there can be other ways of\\ntaking democratic decisions. All the\\npeople can sit together and take\\ndecisions directly.

Once a\\nconstitution is accepted, can we make changes later as required by the\\nchanging conditions?\\nOne recent instance of designing constitution for a democratic state is\\nthat of South Africa.

Its\\nfirst meeting was held in December\\n1946. Soon after, the country was\\ndivided into India and Pakistan. The\\nConstituent Assembly was also\\ndivided into the Constituent Assembly\\nof India and that of Pakistan. The\\nConstituent Assembly that wrote\\nthe Indian constitution had 299\\nmembers. The Assembly adopted\\nthe Constitution on 26 November\\n1949 but it came into effect on 26\\nJanuary 1950. To mark this day we\\ncelebrate January 26 as Republic\\nDay every year.\\nWhy should we accept the\\nConstitution made by this Assembly\\nmore than seven decades ago? We\\nhave already noted one reason\\nabove. The Constitution does not\\nreflect the views of its members\\nalone. It expresses a broad\\nconsensus of its time. Many\\ncountries of the world have had to\\nrewrite their Constitution afresh\\nbecause the basic rules were not\\nacceptable to all major social groups\\nor political parties. In some other\\ncountries, the Constitution exists\\nas a mere piece of paper. No one\\nactually follows it. The experience\\nof our Constitution is different. Over\\nthe last half a century, several\\ngroups have questioned some\\nprovisions of the Constitution. But\\nno large social group or political\\nparty has ever questioned the\\nlegitimacy of the Constitution itself.\\nThis is an unusual achievement for\\nany constitution.\\nThe second reason for accepting\\nthe Constitution is that the\\nConstituent Assembly represented\\nthe people of India. There was no\\nuniversal adult franchise at that\\ntime. So the Constituent Assembly\\ncould not have been chosen directly\\nby all the people of India.

This\\nensured a fair geographical share of\\nmembers from all the regions of the\\ncountry. The Assembly was\\ndominated by the Indian National\\nCongress, the party that led India’s\\nfreedom struggle. But the Congress\\nitself included a variety of political\\ngroups and opinions. The Assembly\\nhad many members who did not\\nagree with the Congress.

The most common form of\\ndemocracy in our times is for the people to govern through their\\nrepresentatives. In this chapter we will look at how these representatives\\nare elected. We begin by understanding why elections are necessary and\\nuseful in a democracy. We try to understand how electoral competition\\namong parties serves the people. We then go on to ask what makes an\\nelection democratic. The basic idea here is to distinguish democratic\\nelections from non-democratic elections.\\nThe rest of the chapter tries to assess elections in India in the light of\\nthis yardstick. We take a look at each stage of elections, from the drawing\\nof boundaries of different constituencies to the declaration of results. At\\neach stage we ask what should happen and what does happen in elections.\\nTowards the end of the chapter, we turn to an assessment of whether\\nelections in India are free and fair.

Let us think of a place\\nwhere representatives are selected\\non the basis of age and experience.\\nOr a place where they are chosen\\non the basis of education or\\nknowledge. There could be some\\ndifficulty in deciding on who is more\\nexperienced or knowledgable. But let\\nus say the people can resolve these\\ndifficulties.

This requires a\\nmechanism by which people can\\nchoose their representatives at\\nregular intervals and change them\\nif they wish to do so. This\\nmechanism is called election.\\nTherefore, elections are considered\\nessential in our times for any\\nrepresentative democracy.\\nIn an election the voters make\\nmany choices:\\n/UIstopThey can choose who will make\\nlaws for them.\\n/UIstopThey can choose who will form the\\ngovernment and take major\\ndecisions.\\n/UIstopThey can choose the party whose\\npolicies will guide the government\\nand law making.\\nW WW WWha haha hahat mak t makt mak t makt mak es an ele es an elees an ele es an elees an ele c cc cction tiontion tiontiondemocr democrdemocr democrdemocr a aa aatic? tic?tic? tic?tic?\\nElections can be held in many ways.\\nAll democratic countries hold\\nelections.

This competition takes\\nvarious forms. The most obvious form\\nis the competition among political\\nparties. At the constituency  level, it\\ntakes the form of competition among\\nseveral candidates. If there is no\\ncompetition, elections will become\\npointless.\\nBut is it good to have political\\ncompetition? Clearly, an electoral\\ncompetition has many demerits. It\\ncreates a sense of disunity and\\n‘factionalism’ in every locality. You\\nwould have heard of people\\ncomplaining of ‘party-politics’ in your\\nlocality. Different political parties and\\nleaders often level allegations against\\none another. Parties and candidates\\noften use dirty tricks to win elections.\\nSome people say that this pressure\\nto win electoral fights does not allow\\nsensible long-term policies to be\\nformulated. Some good people whomay wish to serve the country do not\\nenter this arena. They do not like the\\nidea of being dragged into unhealthy\\ncompetition.\\nOur Constitution makers were\\naware of these problems. Yet they\\nopted for free competition in\\nelections as the way to select our\\nfuture leaders. They did so because\\nthis system works better in the long\\nrun. In an ideal world all political\\nleaders know what is good for the\\npeople and are motivated only by a\\ndesire to serve them. Political\\ncompetition is not necessary in such\\nan ideal world. But that is not what\\nhappens in real life. Political leaders\\nall over the world, like all other\\nprofessionals, are motivated by a\\ndesire to advance their political\\ncareers. They want to remain in\\npower or get power and positions for\\nthemselves.They may wish to serve\\nthe people as well, but it is risky to\\ndepend entirely on their sense of\\nduty. Besides even when they wish\\nto serve the people, they may not\\nknow what is required to do so, or\\ntheir ideas may not match what the\\npeople really want.\\nHow do we deal with this real life\\nsituation? One way is to try and\\nimprove the knowledge and character\\nof political leaders. The other and\\nmore realistic way is to  set up a\\nsystem where political leaders are\\nrewarded for serving the people and\\npunished for not doing so. Who\\ndecides this reward or punishment?\\nThe simple answer is: the people.\\nThis is what electoral competition\\ndoes. Regular electoral competition\\nprovides incentives to political\\nparties and leaders. They know that\\nif they raise issues that people want\\nto be raised, their popularity and\\nchances of victory will increase in\\nthe next elections.

After\\nfive years the term of all the elected\\nrepresentatives comes to an end. The\\nLok Sabha or Vidhan Sabha stands\\n‘dissolved’. Elections are held in all\\nconstituencies at the same time,\\neither on the same day or within a\\nfew days. This is called a general\\nelection.

One of the\\nfeatures of a democratic election is\\nthat every vote should have equal\\nvalue. That is why our Constitution\\nrequires that each constituency\\nshould have a roughly equal\\npopulation living within it.\\nSimilarly, each state is divided into\\na specific number of Assembly\\nconstituencies.

If that happens,\\nour Parliament and Assemblies\\nwould be deprived of the voice of a\\nsignificant section of our population.\\nThat would make our democracy less\\nrepresentative and less democratic.\\nSo, the makers of our Constitution\\nthought of a special system of\\nreserved constituencies for the\\nweaker sections. Some constituencies\\nare reserved for  people who belong\\nto the Scheduled Castes [SC] and\\nScheduled Tribes [ST]. In a SC\\nreserved constituency only someone\\nwho belongs to the Scheduled\\nCastes can stand for election.\\nSimilarly only those belonging to the\\nScheduled Tribes can contest an\\nelection from a constituency\\nreserved for ST. Currently, in the\\nLok Sabha, 84 seats are reserved for\\nthe Scheduled Castes and 47 for the\\nScheduled Tribes (as on  26 January\\n2019). This number is in proportion\\nto their share in the total population.\\nThus the reserved seats for SC and\\nST do not take away the legitimate\\nshare of any other social group.\\nThis system of reservation\\nwas extended later to other\\nweaker sections at the district and\\nlocal level. In many states, seats\\nin rural (panchayat) and urban\\n(municipalities and corporations)local bodies are now reserved for\\nOther Backward Classes (OBC) as\\nwell.

In a democracy\\nthe rulers have to follow some rules and procedures. They have to work\\nwith and within institutions. This chapter is about the working of such\\ninstitutions in a democracy. We try to understand this by looking at the\\nmanner in which major decisions are taken and implemented in our\\ncountry. We also look at how disputes regarding these decisions are\\nresolved. In this process we come across three institutions that play a key\\nrole in major decisions – legislature, executive and judiciary.\\nYou have already read something about these institutions in earlier\\nclasses. Here we shall quickly summarise those and move on to asking\\nlarger questions. In the case of each institution we ask: What does this\\ninstitution do? How is this institution connected to other institutions?\\nWhat makes its functioning more or less democratic? The basic objective\\nhere is to understand how all these institutions together carry on the\\nwork of government. Sometimes we compare these with similar institutions\\nin other democracies. In this chapter we take our examples from the\\nworking of the national level government called Central Government, Union\\nGovernment, or just Government of India.

It collects taxes\\nand spends the money thus raised\\non admi nistration, defence and\\ndevelopm ent programmes. It\\nformulates and implements several\\nwelfare sche mes. Some persons have\\nto take decisions on how to go about\\nthese activities. Others have to\\nimplement these decisions. If\\ndisputes arise on these decisions or\\nin their implementati on, there should\\nbe someone to determine what is\\nright and what is wrong. It is\\nimportant that everyone should\\nknow who is responsible for doing\\nwhat. It is also important that these\\nactivities keep taking place even if\\nthe persons in key positions change.\\nSo, to attend to all these tasks,\\nseveral arrangements are made in\\nall modern democracies.

In Chapter 3 we saw how a democratic\\ngovernment has to be periodically elected by the people in a free and fair\\nmanner. In Chapter 4 we learnt that a democracy must be based on\\ninstitutions that follow certain rules and procedures. These elements are\\nnecessary but not sufficient for a democracy. Elections and institutions\\nneed to be combined with a third element – enjoyment of rights – to make\\na government democratic. Even the most properly elected rulers working\\nthrough the established institutional process must learn not to cross some\\nlimits. Citizens’ democratic rights set those limits in a democracy.\\nThis is what we take up in this final chapter of the book. We begin by\\ndiscussing some real life cases to imagine what it means to live without\\nrights. This leads to a discussion on what we mean by rights and why do\\nwe need them. As in the previous chapters, the general discussion is\\nfollowed by a focus on India. We discuss one by one the Fundamental\\nRights in the Indian Constitution. Then we turn to how these rights can\\nbe used by ordinary citizens. Who will protect and enforce them?

Rights acquire meaning only\\nin society. Every society makes\\ncertain rules to regulate our\\nconduct. They tell us what is right\\nand what is wrong.

When fellow\\ncitizens or the government do not\\nrespect these rights we call it\\nviolation or infringement of our\\nrights.

No\\ncitizen shall be discriminated\\nagainst or made ineligible for\\nemployment on the grounds\\nmentioned above. You have read in\\nChapter 4 that the Government of\\nIndia has provided reservations for\\nScheduled Castes, Scheduled\\nTribes and Other Backward Classes.\\nVarious governments have different\\nschemes for giving preference to\\nwomen, poor or physically\\nhandicapped in some kinds of jobs.\\nAre these reservations against the\\nright to equality? They are not. For\\nequality does not mean giving\\neveryone the same treatment, no\\nmatter what they need. Equality\\nmeans giving everyone an equal\\nopportunity to achieve whatever one\\nis capable of. Sometimes it is\\nnecessary to give special treatment\\nto someone in order to ensure equal\\nopportunity. This is what job\\nreservations do. Just to clarify this,\\nthe Constitution says that\\nreservations of this kind are not a\\nviolation of the Right to Equality.\\nThe principle of non-discrimination\\nextends to social life as well. The\\nConstitution mentions one extreme\\nform of social discrimination, the\\npractice of  untouchability, and\\nclearly directs the government to put\\nan end to it. The practice of\\nuntouchability has been forbidden\\nin any form.

Most people\\nin India, like anywhere else in the\\nworld, follow different religions. Some\\nmay not believe in any religion.\\nSecularism is based on the idea that\\nthe state is concerned only with\\nrelations among human beings, and\\nnot with the relation between human\\nbeings and God. A secular state is one\\nthat does not establish any one\\nreligion as official religion. Indian\\nsecularism practices an attitude of a\\nprincipled and equal distance from\\nall religions. The state has to be\\nneutral and impartial in dealing with\\nall religions.\\nEvery person has a right to\\nprofess, practice and propagate\\nthe religion  he or she believes in.\\nEvery religious group or sect is free\\nto manage its religious affairs. A\\nright to propagate one’s religion,\\nhowever, does not mean that a\\nperson has right to compel another\\nperson to convert into his religion by\\nmeans of force, fraud, inducement or\\nallurement. Of course, a person is free\\nto change religion on his or her own\\nwill. Freedom to practice religion\\ndoes not mean that a person can do\\nwhatever he wants in the name ofreligion. For example, one cannot\\nsacrifice animals or human beings\\nas offerings to supernatural forces\\nor gods. Religious practices which\\ntreat women as inferior or those that\\ninfringe women’s freedom are not\\nallowed. For example, one cannot\\nforce a widow to shave head or wear\\nwhite clothes.\\nA secular state is one that does not\\nconfer any privilege or favour on any\\nparticular religion. Nor does it pun-\\nish or discriminate against people\\non the basis of religion they follow.\\nThus the government cannot com-\\npel any person to pay any taxes for\\nthe promotion or maintenance of\\nany particular religion or religious\\ninstitution.

While\\nFundamental Rights are the source\\nof all rights, our Constitution and\\nlaw offers a wider range of rights.\\nOver the years the scope of rights\\nhas expanded.\\nSometimes it leads to expansion\\nin the legal rights that the citizen can\\nenjoy. From time to time, the courts\\ngave judgments to expand the scope\\nof rights. Certain rights like right to\\nfreedom of press, right to\\ninformation, and right to education\\nare derived from the Fundamental\\nRights. Now school education has\\nbecome a right for Indian citizens.\\nThe governments are responsible for\\nproviding free and compulsory\\neducation to all children up to the\\nage of 14 years. Parliament has\\nenacted a law giving the right to\\ninformation to the citizens. This Act\\nwas made under the Fundamental\\nRight to freedom of thought and\\nexpression. We have a right to seek\\ninformation from government\\noffices. Recently the Supreme Court\\nhas expanded the meaning of the\\nright to life to include the right to\\nfood. Also, rights are not limited only\\nto Fundamental Rights asenumerated in the Constitution.\\nConstitution provides many more\\nrights, which may not be Fundamental\\nRights. For example the right to\\nproperty is not a Fundamental Right\\nbut it is a constitutional right. Right to\\nvote in elections is an important\\nconstitutional right.\\nSometimes the expansion takes\\nplace in what is called human rights.\\nThese are universal moral claims that\\nmay or may not have been recognised\\nby law.

They argue that such\\na displacement is an attack on their  livelihood and beliefs.

One reason for this is that freedom of movement enables\\na person to go to place of work within one’s village or city or to another\\nvillage, city or state. Similarly this right can be used for pilgrimage,\\nconnected with freedom to follow one’s religion. Draw a circle for\\neach right and mark arrows that show connection between or among\\ndifferent rights.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'class9\\\\combined_5.pdf', 'page': 92}, page_content='FOREWO RD\\nThe National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that\\nchildren’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This\\nprinciple marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which\\ncontinues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home\\nand community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF\\nsignify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to\\ndiscourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between\\ndifferent subject ar eas. W e hope these measur es will take us significantly\\nfurther in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in\\nthe National Policy on Education (1986).\\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and\\nto pursue imaginative activities and questions. W e must r ecognise that given\\nspace, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with\\nthe infor mation passed on to them by adults. T reating the pr escribed textbook\\nas the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources\\nand sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is\\npossible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as\\nreceivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching\\ndays is actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and\\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or\\nboredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular\\nburden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching.\\nThe textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority\\nand space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in\\nsmall groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\\nThe National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining (NCER T)\\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\\nresponsible for this book.

Y ou may have hear d this fr om your students or your child.\\nYou may have felt that they had a point.  Syllabi of Civics in our country\\ntend to focus on formal institutions of government. The textbooks are full of\\nconstitutional, legal and procedural details, presented in  a dry and abstract\\nmanner . No wonder childr en experience disconnect between the theory they\\nread in the textbook and what they see in real life around them. This is\\nperhaps what makes Civics ‘boring’ for young adults in a country otherwise\\nfull of passion for politics.\\nThe present textbook is a small step towards changing this. The impetus\\ncame from the National Curriculum Framework 2005 that provided the space\\nand opportunity to bring about this basic change. The foreword to this book\\nby the Dir ector of the NCER T explains the philosophy of the new curriculum.\\nIt meant a complete overhaul of the traditional Civics syllabi. The change in\\nthe name – from Civics to Political Science – reflects the shift in the focus. The\\nnew syllabi recognise that the student at this stage is aware of and needs to\\nknow more about politics. Accordingly, the students in classes IX and X will\\nbe offered an introduction to various facets of politics. Democracy is the\\nwindow through which they get to look at the theory and the practice of\\npolitics.\\nWith this textbook you are going to take the students on a tour of a\\nmuseum of contemporary democracy. Y ou will first take them quickly\\nthrough a series of stories from different parts of the world. Once they develop\\na sense and feel of democracy, you can ask some reflective questions: what\\nis democracy?  Why democracy? With this clarity you can take them to a\\ngallery on constitutions. An understanding of what and how of the\\nconstitutions would prepare them for an exhibition on three aspects of\\ndemocratic politics: elections, institutions and rights. Y ou may encounter\\nmany contentious themes during this tour . Our attempt her e is not to hand\\nover a definite opinion to the students but to enable them to think on their\\nown.\\nThis textbook is meant to help the students enjoy this tour and to assist\\nyou in guiding them. It does not merely inform the students. It encourages\\nthem to think on their own. It interacts with them through questions, moves\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

The tour will continue in the textbook for class\\nX and will focus mor e on the working of democracy. W e hope this tour will\\ncreate interest in them to understand politics more carefully and to help them\\nbecome active and participant citizens.\\nThis hope of ours rests on you. That is why this book makes more\\ndemands on you. Y ou may have to lear n mor e about new names, events and\\nplaces. Y ou may face questions that the textbook does not answer . You may\\nhave to guide the students through sensitive and passionate debates that\\nnaturally arise when we discuss politics. Just when you begin to feel tired or\\nirritated, do entertain a thought. When your student asks a question that\\nyou find dif ficult to answer , when she seeks infor mation that is not easy to\\nfind or expresses an opinion that you don’t approve of, this may actually be\\na sign of your success as a teacher or a parent. As we all know, getting\\nstudents to question is critical to their learning process both as a student\\nand as citizens of a democracy. This is what the present book tries to cultivate.\\nThe desir e to get rid of the ‘boring Civics’ tag br ought together , perhaps for\\nthe first time in our country, a group of political scientists, school teachers and\\neducationists to think about how to teach politics to our next generation.

All these colleagues spared their valuable time and mental space for this\\nunscheduled event in their academic calendar . Professor Krishna Kumar ,\\nDirector NCER T, not only dragged some of us into this pleasant duty but\\nalso supported us at every stage. Pr ofessor Hari V asudevan and Pr ofessor\\nGopal Guru provided this experiment the protection it needed. Professor\\nMrinal Miri, Pr ofessor G. P . Deshpande and other members of the National\\nMonitoring Committee offered valuable inputs and criticisms. The experiment\\ngained many friends on the way: Ambassador Jorge Heine, Arvind Sardana,\\nAditya Nigam, Suman Lata and Chandni Khanduja read different parts of the\\ndraft and provided valuable inputs. At many points it drew upon Lokniti research\\nprogramme and Lokniti network of the Centre for the Study of Developing\\nSocieties for intellectual and logistic resources. Above all, this experiment drew\\nupon the insights and energy of Alex M. George, Pankaj Pushkar and Manish\\nJain – three young educationists committed to a radical pedagogy — who\\ntaught us how to think about the challenge of school education. Designer Oroon\\nDas and cartoonist Irfan Khan and copy editor Devyani Onial helped us turn\\nthe idea of this book into a reality.\\nWe sincer ely hope that you and the students would enjoy this book and\\nperhaps look at politics as something valuable, something worth taking\\nseriously, something worth studying.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'class9\\\\combined_6.pdf', 'page': 64}, page_content='FOREWORD\\nTHE National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that\\nchildren’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school.\\nThis principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning\\nwhich continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the\\nschool, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on\\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\\nboundaries between dif ferent subject ar eas. W e hope these measur es\\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred\\nsystem of education outlined in the National Policy of Education (1986).\\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions.  W e must\\nrecognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new\\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\\nknowledge.\\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as\\nrigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required\\nnumber of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching.

This reader aims at helping the child to read for\\nmeaning, and to learn to communicate in English with confidence and\\naccuracy.\\nCare has been taken to give a central place to the learner in the process\\nof teaching and lear ning. Lear ner-friendly language has been used in\\nthe instructions, and the exercises and activities are addressed to the\\nchild. In this pr ocess the teacher is a facilitator or a co-lear ner.\\nA rich variety of reading material has been provided to include the literary,\\ncultural and sociological dimensions of texts. The themes range from\\nchildhood and adolescence, to disability, talent and achievement, to\\nmusic, science, and contemporary social and environmental concerns.\\nThe range is as inclusive as possible, keeping in view the interest and\\ncognitive development of the learners. The book draws on different genres\\nsuch as story, biography and autobiography; science fiction; humour;\\ntravelogue; and the one-act play.\\nThe number of poems has been increased to help learners explore this\\ngreat source of language, derive the joy of learning through poetry, and\\nunderstand the music of words. An attempt has been made to include\\ndifferent types of poems such as the lyric, the ballad and the humorous\\npoem.\\nThe poems have been chosen for their simplicity and suitability in terms\\nof language and thought. W e need not talk about the poet or the\\nbackground to the poem, unless the poem seems to demand it.  Nor\\nshould we attempt to exhaust all the possibilities of a poem; we should\\nencourage the students to begin to see some of the possibilities.

The Speaking tasks call for lear ners to work in pairs or\\ngroups, (for example) to present an argument, express a viewpoint,\\nexpress contrasts, seek or give an opinion, intr oduce a speaker , tell a\\nstory, enact or read out a play in parts, etc.\\nThere are a variety of writing tasks: help writing newspaper report, an\\narticle for a school magazine, argumentative writing, narration,\\ndescription, and picture interpretation.\\nA small attempt has been made to relate speech and writing by pointing\\nout similarities and differences.

Y ou might want\\nto explain the ideas of ‘virtual reality’ and ‘virtual classroom’. The term\\n‘virtual reality’ refers to a reality created by computer software, and a\\n‘virtual classroom’ is not a real classroom but one where learning is\\nthrough computer software or the Internet. The children may know what\\na robot is, and be able to guess what a robotic teacher would be.\\nIn this unit students are required to present their arguments in a debate.\\nThe following points could be explained before the task.\\n•A debate is a contest between two speakers or two groups of speakers\\nto show skill and ability in arguing.\\n•A proposition, a question or a problem is required for this purpose,\\nwhich can be spoken for or against.\\n•To participate in a debate, one must prepare for it.  So, one must\\nprepare an outline of the main points in the order in which one is\\ngoing to argue.\\n•The time limit is about four to five minutes.\\n•The speaker addresses the audience.\\n•Every topic/subject has its own vocabulary.  These must be learnt.\\n•The speaker addresses the chair (Mr President/Madam), ‘submits’\\nan argument, ‘appeals’ for sympathetic understanding and support,\\n‘questions’ the opponent’s views, and ‘concludes’ an argument.\\n2. T HE SOUND OF MUSIC\\nThese biographical pieces tell us of people who have achieved success\\nand recognition through determination, hard work and courage. The\\nchildren may be asked to think of potential barriers to success, and of\\npeople who have overcome them.

The portraits of musicians given in the beginning may be\\nsupplemented by others that the children can be asked to bring to class.\\nA comprehension exercise in Part II encourages children to find words in\\nthe text that express attitudes (positive, negative or neutral) to events,\\nplaces, etc. Encourage the children to compare and discuss their answers.\\nDictionary entries give us different kinds of information about words.

The instrument so\\ndifferent from the pungi  had to be given a new name.\\nAs the story goes, since it was first played in the\\nShah’s chambers and was played by a nai (barber),\\nthe instrument was named the ‘shehnai ’.\\n2.The sound of the shehnai began to be considered\\nauspicious.

At the age of\\nthree when his mother took him to his maternal\\nuncle’s house in Benaras (now V aranasi), Bismillah\\nwas fascinated watching his uncles practise the\\nshehnai. Soon Bismillah started accompanying his\\nuncle, Ali Bux, to the Vishnu temple of Benaras where\\nBux was employed to play the shehnai. Ali Bux would\\nplay the shehnai and Bismillah would sit captivated\\nfor hours on end. Slowly, he started getting lessons\\nin playing the instrument and would sit practising\\nthroughout the day. For years to come the temple of\\nBalaji and Mangala Maiya and the banks of the Ganga\\nbecame the young apprentice’s favourite haunts where\\nhe could practise in solitude. The flowing waters of\\nthe Ganga inspired him to improvise and invent raagas\\nthat were earlier considered to be beyond the range\\nof the shehnai.\\n6.At the age of 14, Bismillah accompanied his uncle\\nto the Allahabad Music Conference. At the end of\\nhis recital, Ustad Faiyaz Khan patted the young\\nboy’s back and said, “W ork har d and you shall make\\nit.” With the opening of the All India Radio in\\nLucknow in 1938 came Bismillah’s big break.

The class can think about how a ‘great person’ was\\nperceived before being recognised as ‘great’: it is not as though great\\npeople are born with a special sign that allows us to recognise them\\ninstantly! What qualities in a person, then, make them a genius or a\\ngreat person?\\nYou can take the help of a science teacher to explain Einstein’s Theory\\nof Relativity, to talk about Einstein, and build inter -subject cooperation.\\nThe exercise of matching headings to paragraphs in the lesson is useful\\nfor finding the topic sentence or to scan a paragraph for specific\\ninformation. Students may be asked to provide a different heading if\\nthey feel some other point is equally important.\\nStudents should be guided to write a newspaper report. Note the points\\ngiven below. Illustrate them by bringing examples from newspapers into\\nthe class, and ask students to bring their own examples.\\n•A report should have:\\n1.A headline\\n2.Name of the reporter e.g. ‘By a Staff Reporter’, etc.\\n3.Place, date, source ( the source may also be given at the end of the\\nreport).\\n•The beginning is usually an expansion of the headline.  The middle\\nparagraph gives the details.  It is followed by the conclusion or the\\nsumming up.\\n•The report should be brief, but the headline and the style should be\\neye-catching.\\n•Sometimes important points are given in a box in the centre of the\\nreport.\\n•Regarding the language of the reports:\\n1.passives for past action (for example: It is foun d..., ...has been\\nunearthed.)\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",

T HE SNAKE AND THE MIRROR\\n‘The Snake and the Mirror’ is a complex story of self-discovery that is\\nhumorously told. The narrator is a vain and foolish young man who in\\na moment of crisis r ealises that he is “poor , foolish and stupid”. The\\nquestions are designed to help the students notice the humour in the\\nnarration.\\nThis unit has a formal, expository passage for dictation. Students should\\nbe encouraged to learn the spellings of unfamiliar words beforehand.\\nThe dictation of such passages also encourages the development of\\ngrammar in the students’ minds, as they recall complex language.\\nThe W riting task is based on a sketch fr om a photograph that tells a\\nstory. Encourage the students to read the words given alongside the\\nsketch. Let the students form pairs or groups to talk freely about the\\nsketch before they start writing.\\nA new kind of activity introduced in this lesson is to compare two\\ntranslations of the beginning of a story. This activity suggests to the\\nstudents that language is not ‘fixed’; there are different ways of\\nexperiencing an idea, which also lead to small changes in the idea that\\nis expressed. This activity should be done as a fun activity.\\n6. M Y CHILDHOOD\\nThe autobiographical account of childhood embodies the themes of\\nharmony and prejudice, tradition and change.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'class9\\\\combined_7.pdf', 'page': 120}, page_content='FOREWORD\\nTHE National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that\\nchildren’s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This\\nprinciple marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which\\ncontinues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home\\nand community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF\\nsignify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to\\ndiscourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between\\ndifferent subject ar eas. W e hope these measur es will take us significantly\\nfurther in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in\\nthe National Policy of Education (1986).\\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning\\nand to pursue imaginative activities and questions.  W e must r ecognise that,\\ngiven space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging\\nwith the information passed on to them by adults.  Treating the prescribed\\ntextbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other\\nresources and sites of learning are ignored.  Inculcating creativity and\\ninitiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in\\nlearning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\\nimplementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching\\ndays are actually devoted to teaching.  The methods used for teaching and\\nevaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making\\nchildren’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress\\nor boredom.  Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of\\ncurricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different\\nstages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available\\nfor teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving\\nhigher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering,\\ndiscussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\\nThe National Council of Educational Resear ch and T raining ( NCER T)\\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\\nresponsible for this book.  W e wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory\\ngroup in languages, Professor Namwar Singh and the Chief Advisor for\\nthis book, Professor R. Amritavalli for guiding the work of this committee.\\nSeveral teachers contributed to the development of this textbook ; we are\\n2024-25\\n2024-25\\n'),\n",
